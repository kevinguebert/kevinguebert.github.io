*A few weeks late...*

The Product Hunt Maker's Festival 2019 No-Code edition was a blast to work on a a great challenge to all makers.

I'm psyched to [share that I was chosen as "Maker in Chief"!](https://www.producthunt.com/newsletter/2700)[Emoodji](https://coda.io/d/Emoodji_d2tRkelpm2c/History_suC_k?viewMode=play#_luQOO) was chosen as the grand prize winner - a no-code tool I built using Coda.io to track your mood.

What makes [Emoodji special?](https://coda.io/d/Emoodji_d2tRkelpm2c/History_suC_k?viewMode=play#_luQOO) Emoodji is based on the PANAS Scale:

*The PANAS Scale or Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) is a self-report questionnaire. The list is split up into two segments, or mood scales. One scale measures a person’s positive emotion and the other scale measures the negative. Each segment has ten terms, which can be rated on a scale of 1 to 5 to indicate the extent to which the respondent agrees that this applies to him. The PANAS Scale was developed in 1988 by three American psychologists: David Watson, Lee Anna Clark and Auke Tellegen*
