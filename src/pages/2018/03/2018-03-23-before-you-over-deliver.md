This morning's quote from *The $100 Startup* is meaningful and very important. If you sum it up, it basically comes down to make the experience of your product/app as enjoyable as possible *and then more* so that customers are more willing to come back and share. *But*, I think there should be a point before you overdeliver. A trap that I have fallen into is getting too excited about some extra features (the overdelivery), that the core product gets pushed aside. Do not let that happen! The core product is still the *core product*! Before you overdeliver, make sure you actually deliver!
