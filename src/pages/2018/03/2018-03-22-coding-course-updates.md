From my post yesterday, [Things I Wish I Knew (Coding)](/blog/2018/03/21/things-i-wish-i-knew.html), I spent the night thinking about ways to implement these greviences. I will share that I have actually been struggling with this problem for a while now. A year ago I started the course ["An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 1)" by Rice University on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-2) but unfortunately did not finish it...life got in the way at the time. Revisiting learning now, I am not keen on spending $50 a month on it right now. This morning I came across ["Python For Everybody"](https://www.py4e.com/) which looks promising! I will be researching more today and talking to coworkers/friends about the ways to continue.
