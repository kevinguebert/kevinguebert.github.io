> Mnemonic: a device such as a pattern of letters, ideas, or associations that assists in remembering something.

While following my [Python for Everybody](/2018/03/py4e) course, I learned about *mnemonic variable names*, what that means, and how it can enhance programming. If you have been programming for a while now, you were probably taught this at one point in your history. For me, it was instilled in me in my first co-op job. Mnemonic variable naming is simple creating variable names that are indicative of the data they are holding. For example, `x = 40` is pretty basic, but if you change it to `hours_per_week = 40`, you can clearly understand that the value 4 relates to how many hours one may work in a week. If you are a new programmer and starting off, I would recommend trying to use mnemonic variable names as much as possible. It will help with debugging, sharing code, and help deliver better quality code in the end!
