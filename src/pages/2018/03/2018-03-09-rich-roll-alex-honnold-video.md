Incase you didn't know, [Rich Roll](https://richroll.com) holds the top spot in my list of favorite podcasters. This past week he sat down with someone who I've been hearing much more about since starting new job out in Boulder, Colorado.

Alex Honnold will go down in history as one of the best free solo climbers in the world. He has multiple records under his belt and he continues to strive for more.

Combining these two athletes in the same room and having a conversation is something I am looking forward to watching/listening to. Check it out.
