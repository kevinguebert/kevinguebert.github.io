Unfortunately, after 2 renews and 6 weeks, I was unable to finish Ryan Holiday's *Perennial Seller*. One could make excuses on a multitude of reasons, but the excuse coming from me today is that books arrived earlier than expected at the library and my queue was long. Have no fear though! I have already requested it at the library.

Curious what I'm reading next? Check out my [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/lVgkXJ30/reading-list) for the full list!

Right now in my possession I have:

- *The $100 Startup*
- *The Right Stufff*
- *Embrace the Suck*
