**Get Moving.** Ryan Holiday hits the nail on the head witht his chapter in *The Obstacle is the Way.* I could sit here and write out quote after quote of what I wrote down from the chapter - I would recommend just this chapter to anyone who needs that extra push.

Why are we not progressing? Why are we not taking action? Why are we not getting better or meeting our goals? Often times we fear taking action because:

- It's too risky
- It isn't perfect or how we imagined it would be
- It's too expensive
- It's too soon
- Something better may come along (FOMO)
- It might not work

While we sit in fear of taking action because of those things, what are we actually doing? **Nothing. We go nowhere.** You have to start, somewhere, anywhere. Once you start, you can build that momentum and start progressing even faster than before.

But that isn't enough. If you have started, **could you be doing more? Are you giving it your all?**

> "While you're sleeping, traveling, attending meetings, or messing around online...You're going soft. You're not aggressive enough. You're not pressing ahead." (74)

We can always do better - going soft is the opposite of what we want. We want action, progress, efficiency. If you want to get started, if you want to build that momentum, you have to **do**, you have to **go**, you have to **start.** That is all up to you. It will take courage, but, at the most basic form, courage is "really just taking action." So get up, get after it, and get moving.
