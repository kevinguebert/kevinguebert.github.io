> "Nothing *makes* us feel this way, we *choose* to give in to such feelings"

How many of our obstacles, our problems, and our challenges today are based solely on our *perception*? In the new book on my reading list, *The Obstacle is the Way* by Ryan Holiday (see *The Ego is the Enemy*), the opening chapter starts with this idea. Our perception of a situation is what determines the severity of it. If we can turn an obstacle into a *learning experience* then it isn't an obstacle any longer.

Ryan outlines 8 steps for how to use our perception the correct way when facing obstacles:

1. Be objective - don't let feelings or emotions crowd your thoughts and judgments
2. Control emotions & keep an even keel - similar to above, emotions can't rule your perception
3. Choose to see the good in the situation - this is a hard one as it may be tough to see the good in all situations
4. Steady our nerves - hold fast and stay strong, don't get scared
5. Ignore what disturbs or limits others - cryptocurrency crashing? Markets failing? Ignore what scares others
6. Place things in perspective - will that small thing today matter tomorrow?
7. Focus on what can be controlled - at the end of the day, we can only really change what we can control
