> "Play for the name on the front of the jersey and they'll remember the name on the back" - Tony Adams

Ponder on that quote a little - it's pretty profound when you think about it. Many of us are worried about ourselves, our reputation, what people think of us. That's the "Disease of Me" - we put ourselves in front of others because we believe that is the way it should be. We put others down, manipulate others, and do everything we can to make sure that we get ahead. Our ego is putting us ahead of others. But, that comes at a cost - the cost to others. If all the players on a basketball team only focus on themselves, putting them in front of others, in front of the team, then the team suffers. It takes pushing the ego aside to play with each other and for the "name on the front of the jersey." So next time you are in a group project for school or a brainstorming a new project for a client, think about setting your ego aside of trying to get that A or that next promotion and instead focus on the overall goal.
