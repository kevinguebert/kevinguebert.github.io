I don't recall where I heard about this book - maybe it was on a recommended list, maybe someone mentioned it in a podcast, maybe a Tweet - but in any regards, this book caters to a specific audience. Luckily, I fall in that specific audience. **Mind Hacking** uses "geek" like terms and programming analogies to get specific points across. There are actually even code snippets in the text, chapter titles have arrows in them (), and the book references the beginning of Apple, how the internet was born, and important computer scientists across the ages.

In that regard, I became a bit more active and attentive in reading **Mind Hacking.** Is it for everyone though? Maybe not. Did I learn anything I have not already heard? I think so, but if you've read other "self-help" type books, you may not learn anything new. How to set goals, using simulation to help the outcome, reptition, and all the techniques touched on in the book have, at some point, already been a part of your life. Where the book (I imagines) succeeds is in the "workbook" in the back. Sir John Hargrave provides a journal type system for you to use for 21 days to help you practice all the techniques he proposes. For me, the book is a library book so I will not be doing that, but he also has a Coach.Me "app" for others that are interested. The book came out 2 years ago now, so some links are expired, the community isn't as active, and it looks like there may be some technical difficulties from the comments, but at the very least, it is worth checking out [online](https://www.gitbook.com/book/jhargrave/mind-hacking/details).

At the end of the day, this would be a good book to have around "resolution" time. Whenever that is for you, twice a year, once a quarter, or whenever, this book is a good reminder of the process to help you go through to meet those resolutions and achieve your goals.
