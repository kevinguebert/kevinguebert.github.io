An inspiring end to *Own the Day, Own Your Life* - learn to forgive yourself because all you can do is your best. Recently over the past couple of weeks, I've been struggling with this part of "Owning the Day." Marcus' points tread similarly to *Extreme Owenership* by Jocko Willink. As humans, we often think it's better to blame others, create excuses or reasons, and hide behind things we make up. If we instead take the Extreme Ownership point of view, we be able to "look our mistakes right in the eye", learn from them, and move own. From there, as long as we are doing our best, that is all we can ask for. If our best isn't what we envisioned, then we forgive ourselves knowing that we gave it our all, and learn from what happened. That way, next time, we can use what we've learned and do it better.
