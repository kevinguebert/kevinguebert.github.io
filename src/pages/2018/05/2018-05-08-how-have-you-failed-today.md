> "What did you guys fail at this week?" (130)

What a powerful question. What have you failed at this week? The founder of Spanxx, Sara Blakely, was asked this question at the dinner table every night from her father. What have you done this week that lead to failure...and then what did you learn from it? This question has two solid reasons behind why you should ask yourself it:

1. It normalizes failures. If you ask yourself this question every day, failing doesn't seem like that big of a deal. It "loses some of its menace."
2. It requires you to stretch. When you are pushed to fail every day or every week, it requires you to get outside your comfort zone, outside your box, and push yourself to do something you hadn't before. If you fail, you learn. And when you've been failing every day, it doesn't seem like that big of a deal when you fail again - you know how to get yourself back up and push forward.
