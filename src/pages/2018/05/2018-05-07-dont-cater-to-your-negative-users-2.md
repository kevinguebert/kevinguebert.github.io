Imagine for a second that you have a business with hundreds of thousands of users. Some users are loyal and love your product, some are indifferent, and some dislike your product. Now you are incharge of making your users happier - what would your plan of action be? You don't need to worry about the loyal users, they are already happy and love the product. You have to decide if you want to spend time on getting the people that "dislike" your product to be "indifferent" or spend the time on getting the people who are "indifferent" to be "loyal." Which would you choose? Most of us would think spend time on the people who have had the most negative time - make them a bit happier, cater to their needs, and make their experience better, right? That seems to make the most sense. The data however, speaks differently. The unhappy, "dislike" group of users spends the *least* amount of money on your product while the "loyal" group spends the *most* amount of money. In that case, it would make more sense to get more users in the "loyal" category instead of just being "indifferent." Indifferent users spend more than the "dislike" group but not as much as the "loyal" group. If you can then improve the experience of the "indifferent" group to be more like the "loyal" group, then reseaerch has show you will "earn *about 9 times more revenue*" (59). 9 times! Don't fall into the pit of trying to make the people who don't care a priority. Instead, try and give the people who *may* care a little more attention.
