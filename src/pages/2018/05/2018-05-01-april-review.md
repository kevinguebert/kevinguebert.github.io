April is over, May is here. Time to check in on those goals.

> Goal: By Memorial Day 2018, I want to have 100 new posts on a website about something I have learned.

If you want to learn more about this goal, check out [End of January Reflection](/blog/2018/01/31/z-month-1-recap.html).

**Metrics**: In January, I completed exactly 20 blog posts. To meet my goal of 100 new posts by Memorial Day, I would have to average 20 posts a month(ish). In February, I completed 13 blog posts which put me 7 behind the pace. In March, after having a bit of a lapse in the middle of the month and also including this post, I had 32 blog posts.

Now for April, I completed only **15 blog posts**.

**Understanding the Data**: A little bit of a bummer for April. To be honest, I don't quite have a reason for this low number of 15. Fortunately in March, I had 5 extra to give...but I didn't expect to need them all in April. My total is now 80, so I have 20 blog posts to write by Memorial Day (which is the average for each month).

**Going Forward**: May will have to be as strong as March was for me. Reading **12 Rules of Life** is intense, in depth, and philosophical, but that is not an excuse to not write about it or anything. Memorial Day is 28 days away, so my goal is definitely still attainable!

One thing I have come to realize over the past week or so is that 5 months for a SMART goal for me is too long. I'm itching to start something new, get a refresh (or a week off), and set a new date and new goals. I already have some in mind that I'm getting excited about. A new blog CMS, new format, new types of posts, new content...all that good stuff. I also received some great feedback about my writing - [Walk Out of the Woods](/blog/2018/04/28/walk-out-of-woods) was given some praise for its rawness and original thought. Oftentimes I'm summarizing what I read that morning, but sprinkling in personal thoughts is something I can work on.
