As you may have seen, I've [been working](https://kevinguebert.com/2018/06/02/meet-harvy/)[on an app](https://kevinguebert.com/2018/06/07/better-recommendations-with-harvy/) called [Harvy](www.harvy.app). Harvy helps you create time-based playlist for your workouts or runs (or any activity). An idea that's been floating around in my head is using Harvy with the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). The Pomodoro technique is supposed to help you work more productively - you work for 25 minutes, take 5 minutes off, 25 minutes, 5 minutes off, etc. There exist a plethora of apps out there that you can download for your phone, computer, and even smartwatch to help you with these pomodoro sessions. Well, many people work to music, so what if Harvy could help with this? For every sessions, Harvy creates a 25 minute playlist to help you do your work, and, at the end of it, a little notification pops up showing you are done and the music has ended.

I'm debating this being the first iteration of Harvy and temporarily pausing the workout side. I'll keep you updated!
