Love games and are working to get better? Developed by Jane McGonigal, SuperBetter is an approach to life that takes elements of game play and applies it to your daily life. With powerups, quests, allies, and epic wins, SuperBetter helps you reach your goals and achieve your quests in a more fun, engaging way. If you are someone who plays video games and likes the elements that are involved, I would recommend checking out the [SuperBetter website](https://www.superbetter.com/) where you can download the apps and learn more about the program. It's simple to grasp and understand so you don't need to read her 400+ page book to get going!
