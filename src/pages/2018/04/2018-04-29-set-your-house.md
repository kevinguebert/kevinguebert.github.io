**Rule 6: Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world.**

Back in January of this year, I read Jocko Willink's *Extreme Ownership* book which talks about taking ownership of everything that happens in your life. Whether it is good or bad, Jocko states that by taking ownership of it, you can learn and move forward. Rule 6 in Dr. Peterson's book reminds me of that same mentality. If you are suffering, he asks you to start small and consider your circumstances. Reflect a little. "Have you taken full advantage of the opportunities offered to you? Are you working hard on your career, or even your job, or are you letting bitterness and resentment hold you back and drag you down?" (157) Peterson asks you to think about what you can be doing better to change the circumstances of your suffering, of your life, before going out and blaming it on the rest of the world.

> "Stop acting in that particular, despicable manner. Stop saying those things that make you weak and ashamed. Say only those things that make you strong. Do only those things that you could speak of with honour." (158)
