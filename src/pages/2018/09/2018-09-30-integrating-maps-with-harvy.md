If you haven't checked it out yet, last week [maps were introduced to Harvy](https://harvy.app/map)[.](.) I am extremely excited to bring this functionality (well, the start of it) to Harvy and cannot wait to show everyone what is coming down the pipeline. Mapping has been a huge passion of mine so being able to implement it through code has been a blast. Harvy utilizes [Mapbox](https://mapbox.com)as the mapping provider. The reason for this over other services like Google is due to the reputation that Mapbox has as being a great developer resource for getting maps in an application. Other services like [Strava Routes](https://www.strava.com/routes/new) also use Mapbox as their provider, so I figured you can't go wrong with that. 

Right now the main features of this map are adding markers and creating a route for your run (or walk or bike). You can pinpoint where you would like to run and then it will show the total distance. 

This may seem like a small feature, but creating a route is the bases and foundation of the map and the features to come. Making sure that I implemented route making correctly was definitely a priority of mine. [Check it out and let me know what you think, any feedback is good feedback](https://harvy.app/map).
