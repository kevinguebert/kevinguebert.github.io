Last night, with some iced coffe in hand, I was able to deploy the latest update to [Harvy](www.harvy.app). [On Tuesday](2018/06/05/offloading-work-to-spotify/) I talked about taking some of the strain off of Harvy and using Spotify's algorithms instead of creating my own. This latest release does just that!

The user flow now requires one more steps for users to input before picking a playlist. In the future, I would like to have quicker "one-click premade" lists or playlists based on previous listening patterns. But a user inputs songs or artists that they are "feeling" for their activity. For example, last night I went for a quick 30 minute run. I knew I needed something more pump-up, EDM-like, so my inputted songs were "Waiting for Love" and "Levels", both by Avicii. From there, a playlist was crafted based off of those two songs to get similar types of music. A small downside of the current implementation is that the outputted playlist (for some reason), doesn't contain the inputted songs. This will need to be remedied soon. [Let me know if you have any problems or feedback](http://twitter.com/kevinguebert), anything is appreciated!
