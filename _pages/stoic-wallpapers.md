I've talked about [Stoicism](https://dailystoic.com/) a [couple of times](/tag/stoicism.html) here on this blog - many of the books I've read have centered around that idea. *Ego is the Enemy* is the big one that pops in my mind. In the process of all that, I've created a couple phone backgrounds of my favorite quotes that I've come across. I thought I would share for others to also use.
