If you asked me to recommend you a book to read right now, I would recommend you 2 books. The first one is *Extreme Ownership* by Jocko Willink. The second one is *12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos* by Jordan B. Peterson. These two books are battling it out for the top spot on my list of favorite books of this year. 

*12 Rules for Life* is dense, it's philosophical, it's a tough read, but it drives the lesson home hard and impactfully. Are some chapters or pages or stories hard to understand sometimes? Yes. But if you take the time, rewind a bit in, go back a page or two, and start over, the meaning will come to life. I mentioned a couple rules here on this blog, the last one being [Rule 6](/blog/2018/04/29/set-your-house), but I would recommend taking the time to go through all 12 Rules. In theory you could read the title of the chapter and get the quick understanding, but Dr. Peterson goes through and provides the backstory, the build up, and the reasoning for all his rules. If you are looking for a book to read, I would highly recommend it. This book is one that you will want to read once a year as a reminder to yourself of how to act and how to live.
