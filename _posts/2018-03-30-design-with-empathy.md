###### Post inspired from: **Design It! From Programmer to Software Architect** by Michael Keeling

Have you ever used an app or a website or a product and think to yourself "this is terrible, did they even talk to the users beforehand?" That is an example of a team developing far away from their users with an idea of what *they think* users would want. Instead, in designing software and products, one needs to have **empathy** with the stakeholders. The stakeholds include everyone who is going to touch the application - owners, employees, users, IT, support, etc. When you spend time up front talking with the stakeholds and figuring out what *they want* and what their *goal* is, then you can design and architect with more data to create the best architecture possible. It does sound a little like User Experience (UX), but it takes the information into an engineering and architecture perspective that UX Designers are not as focused on.
