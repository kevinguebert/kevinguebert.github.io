Are you a beginner looking to start programming? Are you past the beginner stage and looking to improve your Python skills? I've put together a list of resources that I think can be useful to everyone to help them improve their coding abilities.

*Note* - I am currently going through this list, so I will update date it as I go along!

## Beginning Python

### [Python For Everybody](py4e.com)
I can't say enough about how [great this course is](/blog/2018/04/02/learn-python), if you are new to Python or new to programming in general, I would recommend this course by Chuck Severance.

### [Practice Python for Beginners](https://www.practicepython.org/)
Now the site may not look the best, but this looks like a great resource to do some practice problems.

## Practicing Python

### [The Official Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html)
The Python Documentation may seem verbose or hard to understand, but going through all of it may help you understand some topics or abilities you may miss in regular programming. 

### [PyBites Coding Challenges](https://codechalleng.es/)
What's a better way to practice Python than solving small coding challenges? It keeps you fresh and allows you to push yourself to learn new ways to program.

### [100+ Python Challenging Programming Exercises](https://github.com/zhiwehu/Python-programming-exercises/blob/master/100+%20Python%20challenging%20programming%20exercises.txt)
Now this is just a `.txt` file, so make sure you don't peek at the answer, but the more practice the better, right?

### [Exercism](http://exercism.io/languages/python/exercises)
Exercism is not just for Python, but is a great learning resource with small coding problems for you to do everyday. It's focus is making sure you are learning something new daily by giving you a small, short, but still challenging problem for you to work on.

## Practicing Coding Concepts

### [Building Skills in Object-Oriented Design](http://buildingskills.itmaybeahack.com/book/oodesign-3.1/html/preface.html)
This looks like a great resource to test one's understanding of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) with real world examples. It may look like a lot, but going through actual problems and programs to figure out a solution is a great way to learn.
