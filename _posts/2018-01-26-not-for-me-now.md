I'm throwing in the towel. After starting (aka reading the first chapter) of *Wherever You Go, There You Are* by Jon Kabat-Zinn, I've decided that right now, it isn't the right book for me. I'm not saying in the future it wont be, but right now it isn't my focus. Now you may be thinking, why don't you just fit it in and make it your focus? Well, because I have limits. WYGTYA (*Wherever You Go, There You Are*) shares how to be more mindful, talks about the practice of meditation, better ways to meditate, reasons to meditate, and a ton of really good information about mindfulness. For me, right now, on this the 26th day of January, meditation is not in my top priority list. Other tasks such as getting healthy, eating well, blogging, and learning are all taking up most of my time already. Also, something I've struggled with in the past is having **too much** on my plate so nothing gets done.

In saying that, I will have to remove the book from my list. Well not remove it, but, a small line will go through it crossing it off and symbolizing I did not finish it. Maybe in the future.
