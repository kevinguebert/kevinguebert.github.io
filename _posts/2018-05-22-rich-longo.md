Last week, I finished *The Longevity Diet* by Dr. Valter Longo. I was introduced to this book and to Dr. Longo by a guest on the Rich Roll podcast, one of my favorite podcasts. With lots of people asking Rich to bring Dr. Longo onto the podcast, he was finally able to make it happen. If you don't want to or don't have the time to read the book, at least listen to the podcast, it'll be worth it.
