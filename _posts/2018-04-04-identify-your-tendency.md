###### Post inspired by _The Four Tendencies_ by Gretchen Rubin.

Over the next couple posts, I will be talking about the Four Tendencies describe in Gretchen Rubin's _The Four Tendencies._ However, before I go into them, I want to give you the resources available to figure out your own tendency.

The Four Tendencies outlined in her book are: Upholder, Obliger, Rebel, and Questioner.

To get started, check out her [online quiz](http://www.bit.ly/HabitsQuiz) to help determine which tendency you fall into. Don't worry, it doesn't take more than 5-10 minutes and the reward pays off at the end.
