I've found my favorite podcast of this year. Granted we are only 14 days into it, but if I were to recommend any podcast right now to anyone, I would highly recommend Tim Ferriss' interview of Terry Crews title [Terry Crews â€” How to Have, Do, and Be All You Want](https://tim.blog/2017/12/20/terry-crews-how-to-have-do-and-be-all-you-want/).

I'll admit, I didn't know too much about Terry Crews going into the podcast, but, he the way he talks and shares is spell-bounding. I won't share too much of the details, but one part of the interview Terry Crews talks about how if you want to have something or be something, then **be** it. His example is this - if you want to be rich, then right now, you are rich. Be rich. So the question you ask yourself is, **what would a rich person do?**. Or if you want to be a writer - be a writer. What would a writer do? Well a writer would start writing every day, start taking notes, and publish a book. You are a writer. You are rich. So be it.
