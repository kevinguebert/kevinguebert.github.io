This past January, I set a goal for myself of writing 100 posts before Memorial Day. Well, here it is: post #100. I've learned a few things over the course of the past 5 months that will come in another post, but one thing I have been pondering on is a TedTalk given by Tim Ferriss. Tim Ferriss talks about [defining your fears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5J6jAC6XxAI) in a process he calls [fear setting](https://tim.blog/2017/05/15/fear-setting/). With this process, you define and think about some of the worst case scenarios that could happen for some setting. [In his blog post](https://tim.blog/2017/05/15/fear-setting/), he has 7 Q&As to get you going to move past any inaction you may have and help you define your fears. Check it out - if goal setting hasn't been your thing before, maybe fear setting is more up your alley.
