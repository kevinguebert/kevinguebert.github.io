        <title>Or Are You a Rebel?</title>
        <description>&lt;h6 id=&quot;post-inspired-by-the-four-tendencies-by-gretchen-rubin&quot;&gt;Post inspired by &lt;em&gt;The Four Tendencies&lt;/em&gt; by Gretchen Rubin&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“For Rebels, the ability to choose is so important that sometimes they make a choice–even when it’s against their own self-interest or it’s not what they prefer–just to reassure themselves that they &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; make that choice. (156)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last of the Four Tendencies under &lt;em&gt;The Four Tendencies&lt;/em&gt;, ask yourself if you think these statements apply to you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“You think I can’t business? Watch me.” (157)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You do better when there are no expectations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Resist anything “perceived to be an attempt at control” (160)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Peer pressure may have the opposite result on you&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Resist labels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebels are the smallest Tendency out of all of the Four Tendencies. Rebels &lt;em&gt;resist both outer and inner expectations.&lt;/em&gt; When asking a Rebel to do something, the Rebel is very likely to resist whatever the ask or expectation is. When pushed further on it, the chances the Rebel does it goes down even more. Rebels want to do everything in their own time, and, if someone comes in and pushes them or puts an expectation on them, that may ruin the progress the Rebel has made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;since-rebels-resist-both-outer-and-inner-expectations-the-best-thing-you-can-do-when-workingliving-with-a-rebel-is-frame-the-expectation-as-a-choice-for-the-rebel-to-make-provide-all-the-facts-and-information-but-any-pressure-applied-that-sets-an-expectation-will-not-work-rebels-need-to-feel-like-it-is-something-they-are-in-control-of-and-that-they-decided-rebels-also-respond-well-to-challenges---if-a-rebel-wants-to-lose-weight-it-may-be-better-to-say-looks-like-you-arent-going-to-the-gym-today-instead-of-asking-are-you-headed-to-the-gym-the-second-statement-would-most-likely-get-a-no-and-rebellion-of-not-going-to-the-gym-because-someone-else-is-expecting-them-to-go-to-the-gym&quot;&gt;Since Rebels resist both outer and inner expectations, the best thing you can do when working/living with a Rebel is frame the expectation as a choice for the Rebel to make. Provide all the facts and information but any pressure applied that sets an expectation will not work. Rebels need to feel like it is something they are in control of and that they decided. Rebels also respond well to challenges - if a Rebel wants to lose weight, it may be better to say “looks like you aren’t going to the gym today” instead of asking “are you headed to the gym?” The second statement would most likely get a “no” and rebellion of not going to the gym because someone else is expecting them to go to the gym.&lt;/h2&gt;

        <title>Maybe You're an Obliger?</title>
        <description>&lt;h6 id=&quot;post-inspired-by-the-four-tendencies-by-gretchen-rubin&quot;&gt;Post inspired by &lt;em&gt;The Four Tendencies&lt;/em&gt; by Gretchen Rubin&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The Obliger is the rock of the world. At work, at home, and in life, not only are Obligers the bigger groups, they’re the ones whom people count on the most.” (103)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today’s topic under &lt;em&gt;The Four Tendencies&lt;/em&gt;, ask yourself if you think these statements apply to you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“I put my patients/clients/research team/family ahead of myself.” (103)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You make time for others but struggle with making time for yourself&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No problem meeting expectations set by others&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;May struggle to say no to requests even if you have a heavy workload already&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obligers are the most populous Tendency out of all of them, so it may not be surprising if you fall into the category (statistically speaking). Obligers are those that &lt;em&gt;meet outer expectations&lt;/em&gt; but &lt;em&gt;struggle with meeting inner expectations.&lt;/em&gt; If you know someone that succeeds at work when they have tasks to do set out in front of them by their boss but that person can’t seem to hit the gym even though they want to, they are probably an Obliger. Obligers can sometimes struggle with saying “no” to others while also being okay with letting their personal commitments slide in place of other’s asks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obligers benefit most from external accountability. Whether that is a coach, an instructor, a friend, a spouse, or an app, external accountability helps Obligers change those inner expectations into outer expectations they can hold themselves accountable for. The external accountability can be as simple as disappointing your family if you don’t make it home for dinner (if you have a lot of work) or being charged a payment if you don’t make a fitness class; external accountability helps Obligers meet their inner goals while also balancing their external expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Or Are You an Questioner?</title>
        <description>&lt;h6 id=&quot;post-inspired-by-the-four-tendencies-by-gretchen-rubin&quot;&gt;Post inspired by &lt;em&gt;The Four Tendencies&lt;/em&gt; by Gretchen Rubin&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Questioners show a deep commitment to information, logic, and efficiency. They want to gather their own facts, decide for themselves, and act with good reason; they object to anything they consider arbitrary, ill-reasoned, ill-informed, or ineffective.” (61)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today’s topic under &lt;em&gt;The Four Tendencies&lt;/em&gt;, ask yourself if you think these statements apply to you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“But why?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You dislike the statement “it’s always been done that way”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Value research and learning information about why or what something is&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;May dislike others questioning your decisions because you’ve already done all the research&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look for more efficient and better ways to do tasks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Question arbitrary rules if they don’t have a reason&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again that is just a short rundown of some of the characteristics of Questioners, but I think the name of “Questioner” provides an fairly accurate description itself. Questioners are those who resist outer expectations and meet inner expectations. Rubin shares that Questioners resist the outer expectations until they are given enough information to justify and prove that expectation. When that occurs, those outer expectations often then become inner expectations. If you’ve ever gone to the doctor or the dentist where they told you to “floss every day” or “take this medicine while you eat” and you questioned these statements, chances are you may be a Questioner. The reason for questioning a doctor are part of who you are though - you do not blindly follow rules or authority figures. You want to know the “why” behind the statements, then it will be easier to meet those expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No tendency is perfect though. To others, Questioners may seem like “not a team player” if their bosses have different expectations of them. A Questioner may pepper a team meeting or a boss about why something is which can seem like insubordination or lack of cooperation. Questioners can also get stuck in “analysis-paralysis”. Instead of making a quick decision, there needs to be lots of research, information, and understanding before that decision can be made…which may lead to a “paralysis” of decision making. If you’ve been putting off buying a new car because you’ve been doing research for so long, you may be a Questioner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think? Does that sound like you? Or do you know someone who falls into this category? A good way to help and work with a Questioner is by setting constraints on them. To avoid analysis-paralysis, give the Questioner a deadline or have them max out at a couple options and make them choose from those. For a new car, give them 5 options and a deadline by the end of the month. That way their research is focused but also under a time constraint. Also when dealing with a Questioner, have a “why” for your statements. Giving them “because so-and-so said so” or “because it’s always been done that way” will not satisfy a Questioner. “Why do we need to floss every night?” “Because floss helps prevents ABC which then helps your teeth with XYZ.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Are You an Upholder?</title>
        <description>&lt;h6 id=&quot;post-inspired-by-the-four-tendencies-by-gretchen-rubin&quot;&gt;Post inspired by &lt;em&gt;The Four Tendencies&lt;/em&gt; by Gretchen Rubin&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Upholders are those people who readily respond to outer and inner expectations alike. They meet the work deadline, and they keep the New Year’s resolution, without much fuss.” (27)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully by now you’ve &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2018/04/04/identify-your-tendency&quot;&gt;take Gretchen Rubin’s quiz&lt;/a&gt; to find out which tendency you are, but ask yourself if you think these quotes apply to you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“You observe the rules even when it’s more sensible to ignore them”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If there is a bathroom marked with the opposite sex, you are unable to use it even if it is a single bathroom&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You like crossing items off a list&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You feel uneasy about changes to routines, habits, or schedules&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Planning is your thing and deviating from it can be tough&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After a tough day, you would feel guilty or worse if you skipped a scheduled workout as opposed to letting yourself off the hook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that’s just a quick, quick, quick rundown of some of the characteristics of Upholders, but hopefully you see my point. Upholders can meet the outer expectations and also meet their inner expectations for themselves. Upholders are often reliable though, they follow-through on what the say, and stick to a schedule. Strengths include “self-starter, self-motivated, conscientious, reliable, and thorough.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All tendencies have a weakness though. You may find Upholders can seem “cold” when plans change or diverge from what is expected. They can be uptight and rigid with what they want - if they want to stick to a schedule, that may seem a bit excessive. Bending of rules makes them anxious or nervous, and, now this is not from the book but my own opinion, but taking risks that may break the rules does not sound appealing. Upholders may also have trouble delegating work because they know they can do it and do not know if others will do as good of a job. They will also get frustrated with others are not on the same wavelength or expectation level as them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think? Does that sound like you? Or do you know someone who falls into this category? Well if you know that about a person, that can help you in your interactions. If you are frustrated because your coworker or spouse isn’t being “letting loose” and doing something that bends the rules, it may be because they are an Upholder. Or maybe you have an appointment and the Upholder is pressuring you to get ready quickly so you won’t be late - don’t take that as being mean or cold-hearted, that’s just who they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Python Learning Guide</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you a beginner looking to start programming? Are you past the beginner stage and looking to improve your Python skills? I’ve put together a list of resources that I think can be useful to everyone to help them improve their coding abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt; - I am currently going through this list, so I will update date it as I go along!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;beginning-python&quot;&gt;Beginning Python&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;python-for-everybody&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;py4e.com&quot;&gt;Python For Everybody&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t say enough about how &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2018/04/02/learn-python&quot;&gt;great this course is&lt;/a&gt;, if you are new to Python or new to programming in general, I would recommend this course by Chuck Severance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;practice-python-for-beginners&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.practicepython.org/&quot;&gt;Practice Python for Beginners&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the site may not look the best, but this looks like a great resource to do some practice problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;practicing-python&quot;&gt;Practicing Python&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-official-python-documentation&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html&quot;&gt;The Official Python Documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Python Documentation may seem verbose or hard to understand, but going through all of it may help you understand some topics or abilities you may miss in regular programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pybites-coding-challenges&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://codechalleng.es/&quot;&gt;PyBites Coding Challenges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s a better way to practice Python than solving small coding challenges? It keeps you fresh and allows you to push yourself to learn new ways to program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;100-python-challenging-programming-exercises&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zhiwehu/Python-programming-exercises/blob/master/100+%20Python%20challenging%20programming%20exercises.txt&quot;&gt;100+ Python Challenging Programming Exercises&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this is just a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.txt&lt;/code&gt; file, so make sure you don’t peek at the answer, but the more practice the better, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;exercism&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://exercism.io/languages/python/exercises&quot;&gt;Exercism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercism is not just for Python, but is a great learning resource with small coding problems for you to do everyday. It’s focus is making sure you are learning something new daily by giving you a small, short, but still challenging problem for you to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;practicing-coding-concepts&quot;&gt;Practicing Coding Concepts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-skills-in-object-oriented-design&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://buildingskills.itmaybeahack.com/book/oodesign-3.1/html/preface.html&quot;&gt;Building Skills in Object-Oriented Design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looks like a great resource to test one’s understanding of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) with real world examples. It may look like a lot, but going through actual problems and programs to figure out a solution is a great way to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

        <title>Identify Your Tendency</title>
        <description>&lt;h6 id=&quot;post-inspired-by-the-four-tendencies-by-gretchen-rubin&quot;&gt;Post inspired by &lt;em&gt;The Four Tendencies&lt;/em&gt; by Gretchen Rubin&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next couple posts, I will be talking about the Four Tendencies describe in Gretchen Rubin’s &lt;em&gt;The Four Tendencies.&lt;/em&gt; However, before I go into them, I want to give you the resources available to figure out your own tendency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Four Tendencies outlined in her book are: Upholder, Obliger, Rebel, and Questioner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started, check out her &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bit.ly/HabitsQuiz&quot;&gt;online quiz&lt;/a&gt; to help determine which tendency you fall into. Don’t worry, it doesn’t take more than 5-10 minutes and the reward pays off at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bit.ly/HabitsQuiz&quot;&gt;Take the quiz here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Want to learn how to code? Start here</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been following along on a little series I’ve had here on the blog, you will know that recently I’ve been looking into ways to improve my coding skills. It started off with &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2018/03/21/things-i-wish-i-knew&quot;&gt;Things I wish I Knew (Coding Edition)&lt;/a&gt;, followed by &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2018/03/22/coding-course-updates&quot;&gt;Things I Wish I Knew - Progress&lt;/a&gt;, and then &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2018/03/23/py4e&quot;&gt;A New Coding Course&lt;/a&gt; if you would like to check out the timeline of events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I am proud to say that I have officially completed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.py4e.com/&quot;&gt;Python for Everybody&lt;/a&gt; course this past weekend, and, if you want to learn how to program, I would &lt;strong&gt;highly recommend&lt;/strong&gt; taking this class. The videos are broken up into manageable chunks, the lessons aren’t too long, and Chuck Severance goes through all the topics extremely well. If you take an hour out of your day to go through a lesson or two, you would be up and running in no time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topics Covered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Functions, variables, expressions, loops, strings, &amp;amp; conditions (basics of programming)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working with files&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lists &amp;amp; Dictionaries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tuples (which I thought was pronounced with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;toop&lt;/code&gt; and not a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tup&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Regular Expressions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Networks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Web Services &amp;amp; APIs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Object Orient Programming&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Databases&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some data visualization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>End of March Reflection</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;March has come and gone, time to reflect on any progress of my goals!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;goal-by-memorial-day-2018-i-want-to-have-100-new-posts-on-a-website-about-something-i-have-learned&quot;&gt;Goal: By Memorial Day 2018, I want to have 100 new posts on a website about something I have learned.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about this goal, check out &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2018/01/31/z-month-1-recap.html&quot;&gt;End of January Reflection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metrics&lt;/strong&gt;: In January, I completed exactly 20 blog posts. To meet my goal of 100 new posts by Memorial Day, I would have to average 20 posts a month(ish). In February, I completed 13 blog posts which put me 7 behind the pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March, after having a bit of a lapse in the middle of the month and also including this post, I had &lt;strong&gt;32 blog posts&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding the Data&lt;/strong&gt;: To be honest, a bit of a surprise for me! Here are a couple notes about having 32 blog posts in March:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I successfully made up my 7 post deficit from February&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I am now 5 posts ahead of my planned schedule of 20 posts a month&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brings my total blog posts to 65 - 35 to go before Memorial Day!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going Forward&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m not going to lie, the book I’m reading right now &lt;em&gt;Design It!&lt;/em&gt; is not too exciting to blog about. It’s very software/programming focused. However, I do have other books on the way that will provide (in my mind), better material. I do feel like I’ve been in more of a “groove” with posting though, so I would like to continue that in the month of April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with the design update in March, I’ve also added commenting to certain posts that I feel are suitable for comments. My &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2018/01/09/look-then-leap&quot;&gt;Look then Leap&lt;/a&gt; post has received a fair amount of traffic so I recently added commenting there and have also received a comment! Not all posts will have comments though, it is based off of if I feel it would provide benefit. Feel free to provide any feedback or let me know what you think below!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Design with Empathy</title>
        <description>&lt;h6 id=&quot;post-inspired-from-design-it-from-programmer-to-software-architect-by-michael-keeling&quot;&gt;Post inspired from: &lt;strong&gt;Design It! From Programmer to Software Architect&lt;/strong&gt; by Michael Keeling&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever used an app or a website or a product and think to yourself “this is terrible, did they even talk to the users beforehand?” That is an example of a team developing far away from their users with an idea of what &lt;em&gt;they think&lt;/em&gt; users would want. Instead, in designing software and products, one needs to have &lt;strong&gt;empathy&lt;/strong&gt; with the stakeholders. The stakeholders include everyone who is going to touch the application - owners, employees, users, IT, support, etc. When you spend time up front talking with the stakeholders and figuring out what &lt;em&gt;they want&lt;/em&gt; and what their &lt;em&gt;goal&lt;/em&gt; is, then you can design and architect with more data to create the best architecture possible. It does sound a little like User Experience (UX), but it takes the information into an engineering and architecture perspective that UX Designers are not as focused on.&lt;/p&gt;
