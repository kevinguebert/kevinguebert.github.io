   <title>Accountability Tracking</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Curious about how to automate some of your accountability? This month for my tracking, I implemented a version 1 plan to automate my tracking by using two services: &lt;a href=&quot;ifttt.com&quot;&gt;IFTTT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;zapier.com/apps&quot;&gt;Zapier&lt;/a&gt;. IFTTT is “If this then that” and Zapier is a very similar service more focused on the business aspect of tasks. What you can do is set up certain “triggers” which then create an output. The way I use it is by using the triggers to add events to a shared Google Calendar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:
Every time I have a workout on Strava, it creates an event on the calendar.
Every time I commit code to my side projects, it will create an event.
Every time I press a button on my watch, it will create an event correspoding to that button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also use this for tracking how my “todo” list is coming along by using Trello. Every time I mark a card as “done” it adds it to the calendar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m only a couple days in, but if you are looking for a new way, I would recommend checking out those two services!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“When strong ideas take root, they can sometimes crowd out competitors so thoroughly that alternatives can’t prosper. Sometimes the best way to spark creativity is by disturbing things just enough to let some light through.” (231)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of us have been there - we are stuck on a project or a task and can’t seem to make any progress. We have maybe gone down one path and it seems like there isn’t an end in sight or there’s no good way to continue. This time period is prime for a distruption. One of the great thigns about iterative design is that it can always take in feedback and be updated without having to do the whole project over again. We can get stuck on one idea of how the problem should be solved that we fail to see the other possible plans that could be better. Maybe next time we are stuck on a task, take a break and go for a run. Or clean the kitchen. Or do something to break up that brain pattern of thing in one way, it may prove to find a better solution.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Building Team Culture</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h6 id=&quot;post-inspired-from-smarter-faster-better-the-secrets-of-being-productive-in-life-and-business-by-charles-duhigg&quot;&gt;Post inspired from: &lt;strong&gt;Smarter Faster Better. The Secrets of Being Productive in Life and Business&lt;/strong&gt; by Charles Duhigg&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“But if you’re an entrepreneur and you’re betting on just one company, then the data says you’re much better off with a commitment-focused culture” - James Barron (150)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When talking about jobs and comparing millenials to the older generations, oftentimes we see a stark difference between the job attitudes between the two generations. The older generations often have been with the same company for years upon years, 20, 25, 30+, while in the millenial culture, many hop around jobs every couple of years. Me personally, I’m at my second job 2 years out of college already. Charles Duhigg’s chapter on “Managing Others” talks about how different teams leads to different types of outcomes. There is the All-Star team with all the Ivy School-like kids, there’s the autocratic team, the dictatorship-like team (“if I say do this, do it”), the engineering team, and then lastly there’s a team he calls the “commitment team.” First glance, out of all of these you would think “the all-start team is the way to go” - it is made up of all the smartest people in the room, of course that makes most sense. Or next up maybe the engineering team with long coding sessions and great technical skills. However, it is in fact the commitment team that perfroms the best over time. Companies that push for the strongest culture, oftentimes before the best product is delivered, have a higher rate of success than all the others. Companies with better maternity leave, relaxed work-from-home policies, day care options, and all those perks that aren’t necessarily “day-to-day” perks like free food or a ping-pong table ended up having stronger employee loyalty and higher rates of success. People &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to go to work when they feel like the company is committed to them. Committment from the company then leads to commitment from the employee to output their best work and to even stay if they are being headhunted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe then, one of the first employees at a new company should be a great HR representative that puts culture first instead of all-star employees that may let their ego’s get in the way.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Have to Stretch and Be SMART</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/03/01/stretch-and-smart.html"/>
   <updated>2018-03-01T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/03/01/stretch-and-smart</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h6 id=&quot;post-inspired-from-smarter-faster-better-the-secrets-of-being-productive-in-life-and-business-by-charles-duhigg&quot;&gt;Post inspired from: &lt;strong&gt;Smarter Faster Better. The Secrets of Being Productive in Life and Business&lt;/strong&gt; by Charles Duhigg&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“To-do lists are great if you use them correctly, but when people say things like ‘I sometimes write down easy items I can cross off right away, because it makes me feel good,’ that’s exactly the &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; way to create a to-do list” - Timothy Pychcyl (129)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve all heard of SMART Goals - &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;pecific &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;easureable &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;chievable &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;ealistic and &lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;imeline. I think I recall first hearing about them when I was in school. I don’t recall what age, but it may have been in middle or high school. In talking about SMART goals, we lay out a plan for a goal we want to achieve and break it down into those 5 pieces - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timeline. With these 5 parts created, we then have a plan laid out in front of us that helps us tackle any goal. Charles Duhigg in &lt;em&gt;Smarter Faster Better&lt;/em&gt; argues that SMART goals are not enough. With SMART goals, one can get in this mindset of only focusing on the short term achievable goals. Like the quote above, if someone is just creating SMART goals and wanting to check off the items in the list, that person then loses sight of other aspects that can be improved. Setting a smart goal to improve sales by 20% this quarter is a good goal, but if in doing that goal one loses sight of a bigger picture, maybe building a network that will last many years to continue selling to, then the long term progress of SMART goals is missed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duhigg then crafts a better way to create goals by combining two different systems - creating a Stretch goal and then combining that with SMART goals. He wants you to think big, to dream big - “if you do know how to get there - it’s not a stretch target” (125). Stretch goals should be goals that seem &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; impossible. If you try and lay out the steps right now, you wouldn’t quite know the path to get there. But, at the same time, they also need to be a little in reach too. There is a fine line between a Stretch goal and an impossible goal. When a Stretch goal is created, then you can start crafting the SMART goals that would go along with it. You can start creating “proximal goals” - smaller ambitions and tasks that help one build up to succeeding. So if your stretch goal is to run a marathon, a very good proximal goal would be to 5 miles without stopping. Then when that is completed you run 10 miles without stopping, so on and so forth. These proximal goals build upon each other to help reach the Stretch goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this all mean? Next time you do a yearly review with your boss or you are trying to accomplish something, set a Stretch goal first. Something that seems almost impossible. Then break that down into smaller SMART goals that will build up and help you achieve that Stretch. You’ve got to Stretch and be SMART about it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>End of February Reflection</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/03/01/february-review.html"/>
   <updated>2018-03-01T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/03/01/february-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;February has come to a close! A short month, but still time to reflect on progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;goal-by-memorial-day-2018-i-want-to-have-100-new-posts-on-a-website-about-something-i-have-learned&quot;&gt;Goal: By Memorial Day 2018, I want to have 100 new posts on a website about something I have learned.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about this goal, check out &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2018/01/31/z-month-1-recap.html&quot;&gt;End of January Reflection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metrics&lt;/strong&gt;: In January, I completed exactly 20 blog posts. To meet my goal of 100 new posts by Memorial Day, I would have to average 20 posts a month(ish). In February, I completed &lt;strong&gt;13 blog posts&lt;/strong&gt;. That puts me &lt;strong&gt;7 behind the pace&lt;/strong&gt; 🙃. Not exactly what I am looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reasons/Excuses&lt;/strong&gt;: What caused this lack of blog posts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Less reading&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Completely out of town from February 1-4th&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Guests from February 22-27th. 
But, that is more of an excuse than anything. I did not prioritize creating a blog post on those days, and right now, I’m okay with that. I believe I can make up those 7 in the next 3 months as long as I keep on track.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ways to get back on track&lt;/strong&gt;: My morning routine was shifted with the above activities. I succeed when I have my time to read in the morning and then reflect on my reading. What about days when I don’t have that luxury? I should recognize that early on in the day (I have a basic idea of how my schedule will look), and then try and look for items I come across that could make a good (can be short) post. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Something is better than nothing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Anticipate</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If you’re not humble, life will visit humbleness upon you” - Mike Tyson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear setting. Premortems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these are tools to help one anticipate and act correctly. These tools help one evision what could go wrong, all the possible scenarios, before anything actually starts. Say you have a big app launch coming up - do a premortem to figure out all the possible failure scenarios so that you can anticipate and be prepared for them. What if the app gets really popular and there are too many people? That isn’t a bad scenario to have, but also if the app fails because of it, that would be something to anticipate. Or (speaking from a recent experience), what if the road gets covered by snow and ice and your car is ill-equipped to handle it? Do you wake up that morning having to figureo ut a plan or do you anticipate this possible scenario? “The only guarantee is things will go wrong,” it is up to us to be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of this however is that one may seem like a pessimist. When you are always imagining the possible failures, many of which may not even come to pass, it may seem like a pessimistic point of view. But, to challenge that, is it not better to be prepared for what could happen then to be caught suprised? One can discover the weakness in plans and know how to react and counter any scenario when they arrive. It is far better to be prepared for a scenario than to have the scenario catch you by surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Do. Your. Job.</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/02/22/do-your-job.html"/>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Everything we do matters…Everything is a chance to do and be your best. Only self-absorbed assholes think they are too good for whatever their current station requires.” (94)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a powerful quote. Our lives are filled with ups and downs, successes and failures. In every moment though, it all matters. Ever moment is “a chance to do and be our best.” It is our &lt;em&gt;job&lt;/em&gt; to do and be our best. Ryan Holiday outlines what our response should be to our job:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hard work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Honest&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Helping others as best we can&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the point of it though? That’s a question with a simple answer: to do your job. That’s all there is to it. Doing your job also helps you out in more ways than just productivity. Have you ever done lack-luster work and then looked back onto it with a sense of guilt? Or the thought that “I could have done better”? If you do your best in every situation, you can then “be proud of our choices and confident they’re the right ones” (95). If we do our best, put in our best effort, and do the job, then there’s nothing more we could have done. There is no after-thought or guilt that follows us around - we did our best and are confident it was the right decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each small thing you do is part of the larger goal. Don’t forget that goal, but also remember the small moments as those are what help you reach your goal.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Always Be Moving</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“So when you’re frustrated in pursuit of your own goals, don’t sit there and complain that you don’t have what you want. If you haven’t even tried yet, then of course you will still be in the exact same spot. You haven’t pursued anything.” (75)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Moving.&lt;/strong&gt; Ryan Holiday hits the nail on the head witht his chapter in &lt;em&gt;The Obstacle is the Way.&lt;/em&gt; I could sit here and write out quote after quote of what I wrote down from the chapter - I would recommend just this chapter to anyone who needs that extra push.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are we not progressing? Why are we not taking action? Why are we not getting better or meeting our goals? Often times we fear taking action because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s too risky&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It isn’t perfect or how we imagined it would be&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s too expensive&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s too soon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Something better may come along (FOMO)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It might not work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we sit in fear of taking action because of those things, what are we actually doing? &lt;strong&gt;Nothing. We go nowhere.&lt;/strong&gt; You have to start, somewhere, anywhere. Once you start, you can build that momentum and start progressing even faster than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that isn’t enough. If you have started, &lt;strong&gt;could you be doing more? Are you giving it your all?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“While you’re sleeping, traveling, attending meetings, or messing around online…You’re going soft. You’re not aggressive enough. You’re not pressing ahead.” (74)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can always do better - going soft is the opposite of what we want. We want action, progress, efficiency. If you want to get started, if you want to build that momentum, you have to &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt;, you have to &lt;strong&gt;go&lt;/strong&gt;, you have to &lt;strong&gt;start.&lt;/strong&gt; That is all up to you. It will take courage, but, at the most basic form, courage is “really just taking action.” So get up, get after it, and get moving.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Altering Your Perception</title>

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I talked a bit about ways to change your perception: being object, controlling your emotions, etc. Today I wanted to dive a little deeper into it after reading more. When we have a friend or coworker tht has a problem, we oftentimes can easily add our own advice. Why is this? Well, when the situation isn’t happening to us, we can look at it &lt;em&gt;objectively.&lt;/em&gt; We don’t have that ego butting into our decision making when the decision isn’t ours to make, but, once we are in a similar situation ourselves, we struggle with that same problem. Our emotions cloud our judgment and we lack the objectivity to view the obstacle in the most basic form. Our perspective is everything though. If we can take that obstacle, break it down and look at it objectively and through a different perspective, we can then see the other opportunities that exist. We can then flip the obstacle on its head and make it an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time you face an obstacle, a challenge, or a problem, try taking a step back. Have a conversation with yourself - do I need to freak out over this? What if this was happening to someone else? What am I missing?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Steps for Changing our Perception</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/02/19/steps-for-perception.html"/>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Nothing &lt;em&gt;makes&lt;/em&gt; us feel this way, we &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; to give in to such feelings”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many of our obstacles, our problems, and our challenges today are based solely on our &lt;em&gt;perception&lt;/em&gt;? In the new book on my reading list, &lt;em&gt;The Obstacle is the Way&lt;/em&gt; by Ryan Holiday (see &lt;em&gt;The Ego is the Enemy&lt;/em&gt;), the opening chapter starts with this idea. Our perception of a situation is what determines the severity of it. If we can turn an obstacle into a &lt;em&gt;learning experience&lt;/em&gt; then it isn’t an obstacle any longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryan outlines 8 steps for how to use our perception the correct way when facing obstacles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be objective - don’t let feelings or emotions crowd your thoughts and judgments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Control emotions &amp;amp; keep an even keel - similar to above, emotions can’t rule your perception&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Choose to see the good in the situation - this is a hard one as it may be tough to see the good in all situations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Steady our nerves - hold fast and stay strong, don’t get scared&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ignore what disturbs or limits others - cryptocurrency crashing? Markets failing? Ignore what scares others&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Place things in perspective - will that small thing today matter tomorrow?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on what can be controlled - at the end of the day, we can only really change what we can control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Mind Hacking</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind Hacking: How to Change Your Mind for Good in 21 Days&lt;/strong&gt; by Sir John Hargrave&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t recall where I `heard about this book - maybe it was on a recommended list, maybe someone mentioned it in a podcast, maybe a Tweet - but in any regards, this book caters to a specific audience. Luckily, I fall in that specific audience. &lt;strong&gt;Mind Hacking&lt;/strong&gt; uses “geek” like terms and programming analogies to get specific points across. There are actually even code snippets in the text, chapter titles have arrows in them (&lt;Title&gt;), and the book references the beginning of Apple, how the internet was born, and important computer scientists across the ages.&lt;/Title&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that regard, I became a bit more active and attentive in reading &lt;strong&gt;Mind Hacking.&lt;/strong&gt; Is it for everyone though? Maybe not. Did I learn anything I have not already heard? I think so, but if you’ve read other “self-help” type books, you may not learn anything new. How to set goals, using simulation to help the outcome, reptition, and all the techniques touched on in the book have, at some point, already been a part of your life. Where the book (I imagines) succeeds is in the “workbook” in the back. Sir John Hargrave provides a journal type system for you to use for 21 days to help you practice all the techniques he proposes. For me, the book is a library book so I will not be doing that, but he also has a Coach.Me “app” for others that are interested. The book came out 2 years ago now, so some links are expired, the community isn’t as active, and it looks like there may be some technical difficulties from the comments, but at the very least, it is worth checking out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gitbook.com/book/jhargrave/mind-hacking/details&quot;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, this would be a good book to have around “resolution” time. Whenever that is for you, twice a year, once a quarter, or whenever, this book is a good reminder of the process to help you go through to meet those resolutions and achieve your goals.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Mind Repetition</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h6 id=&quot;post-inspired-from-mind-hacking-by-sir-john-hargrave&quot;&gt;Post inspired from: &lt;strong&gt;Mind Hacking&lt;/strong&gt; by Sir John Hargrave&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lather. Rinse. Repeat.&lt;/em&gt; When working on personal-growth, getting better, and working towards out goals, repetition is key. It takes discipline and doing that task every day to form it into a habit which while hopefully lead to success. Sir John Hargrave proposes 3 different ways that can help “remind your mind” with these goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Repetition Reminders”: These are reminders that you will see often - think of a sticky note on the fridge before you open it, sharpie quotes on your mirror, phone backgrounds, daily reminders for the same task. Something where every time you see it, you are reminded of your goal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Repetition Trackers”: At the start of the New Year, I printed out 3 calendars and put them on my wall. Every day if I complete the task on that calendar, I mark an X on it. This is a form of using Jerry Seinfeld’s “Don’t Break the Chain” methodology. I want to see what the longest chain of crossing off days I can create.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Talking to Yourself”: This methodology is using positive reinforcement while you may be doing seemingly mundane tasks to retrain your brain. While your commuting or exercising, talk to yourself that you are going to succeed. Think about doing a fitness activity - you may think you can’t get that last rep or hit that pace, but talking to your self, “I can do this” can help train the mind to push you farther.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Play for the name on the front of the jersey and they’ll remember the name on the back”
Tony Adams&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ponder on that quote a little - it’s pretty profound when you think about it. Many of us are worried about ourselves, our reputation, what people think of us. That’s the “Disease of Me” - we put ourselves in front of others because we believe that is the way it should be. We put others down, manipulate others, and do everything we can to make sure that we get ahead. Our ego is putting us ahead of others. But, that comes at a cost - the cost to others. If all the players on a basketball team only focus on themselves, putting them in front of others, in front of the team, then the team suffers. It takes pushing the ego aside to play with each other and for the “name on the front of the jersey.” So next time you are in a group project for school or a brainstorming a new project for a client, think about setting your ego aside of trying to get that A or that next promotion and instead focus on the overall goal.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Story In Your Head</title>

&lt;p&gt;Do you think when Bill Gates was starting Microsoft he thought to himself - “People are going to love the story of starting up this company in a garage”? Not at all - he wasn’t worried about the story that was going to be told about him. He wasn’t worried about what others thought of him. He was setting his ego aside and &lt;em&gt;doing the work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set aside the ego - don’t tell yourself a story. “I’m going to be the next X” or “this will be great to tell in the future.” Taking a picture of the “early days” of a startup for “the future media” - you’re already telling yourself a story. Ego is clouding your judgement, ego is preventing you from &lt;em&gt;doing the work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;fac-si-facis-do-it-if-youre-going-to-do-it&quot;&gt;Fac, si facis: “Do it, if you’re going to do it”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the difference between working for a company and owning a company with employees? What is the difference between a snowboarding going to the Olympics and an amateur riding in the terrain park?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking at the two people - the professionals vs amateurs - the difference between the two is the amount of work put into the craft. Sitting down and saying “I’m going to be a professional athlete” is &lt;strong&gt;not enough.&lt;/strong&gt; Thinking and accepting this idea that you may have is not enough to get you to that level. You &lt;strong&gt;must work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way though, our ego is going to get in the way. Our ego wants our ideas, wants us to aspire to something, it wants that attention and glory of saying you are going to do something (echoing a previous post, The Dope Addiction). But in saying something, we are not progressing - there is no work being done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When you are not practicing, someone out there is, and when you meet him, he will win”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Bill Bradley&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practice. Work. Improve. Every time you sit down to work on that side project, to study, to prepare for an exam, to do your homework, remind yourself that the work you are doing is an investment in yourself. Do the work.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Passion, Don't Be Mislead</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Post inspired from: &lt;strong&gt;Ego is the Enemy&lt;/strong&gt; by Ryan Holiday&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We hear what we want to hear, we do what we feel like doing, and despite being increasingly busy and working ourselves very hard, we accomplish very little”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Ryan Holiday (47)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this day in age, it’s all about passion. “Find your passion” and “follow your passion” are plastered everywhere - from Instagram posts to self-help books. I read these same books and look at these same Instagram posts - follow your passions and everything will work out. Ryan Holiday in &lt;em&gt;Ego is the Enemy&lt;/em&gt; counters those sayings by saying “don’t be passionate”. “Passion typically masks weakness.” After pondering on it for a day, I think I’ve slowly come to agree with him. In moments where I’ve been passionate about a new idea or a new project, there is weakness in that moment. Why? Well because it is a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; project. What happened to my other ones? Well I am masking the fact that I did not complete them, that I lost my passion for them, and, to echo Jocko Willink, I was not disciplined to follow through. Passion is masking my weakness. Holiday actually uses a book I am a fan of to outline this exact scenario - &lt;em&gt;Into the Wild.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Into the Wild&lt;/em&gt; follows the story of a man who follows his passion into the wilderness where he eventually passes away because his passion hid misunderstanding and lack of preparation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does Ryan Holiday offer as a solution? &lt;strong&gt;Purpose and Realism.&lt;/strong&gt; Purpose is “passion with boundaries” while Realism is “detachment and perspective”. Passion is &lt;strong&gt;about&lt;/strong&gt; while Purpose is &lt;strong&gt;to and for&lt;/strong&gt;. Purpose is pursing something outside of yourself, something greater. Realism helps us ask the questions of where to start and what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time you find yourself passionate about an idea then, reframe it - what is the true purpose of it? Being passionate about an idea is easy, but the follow through is hard if there is not a purpose attached to it. “Make it about what you feel you &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; do and say, not what you &lt;strong&gt;care&lt;/strong&gt; about and wish for.”&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>End of January Reflection</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/31/z-month-1-recap.html"/>
   <updated>2018-01-31T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/31/z-month-1-recap</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The first month of 2018 has come to a close. How did you do on your resolutions? How are they coming along? I wanted to reflect a little bit on my resolutions and provide an update on how I’m doing as a sort of accountability to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;by-memorial-day-2018-i-want-to-have-100-new-posts-on-a-website-about-something-i-have-learned&quot;&gt;By Memorial Day 2018, I want to have 100 new posts on a website about something I have learned.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I call this the “learn and share” goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the purpose of it?&lt;/strong&gt; To challenge myself to learn more, read more, and then share what I’ve learned so that others may learn from it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the progress?&lt;/strong&gt; So far, this goal has taken form by reading books. Lots of books. As you may see on the left sidebar, I’ve read more books this month than any month in my past - some are for fun (&lt;strong&gt;Altered Carbon&lt;/strong&gt;) while others are more learning focused (&lt;strong&gt;Algorithms to Live By&lt;/strong&gt;) and then others are more life and reflection focused (&lt;strong&gt;Siddhartha&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the metrics?&lt;/strong&gt; To get into the nitty gritty, Memorial Day is at the end of May the 5th month of the year. 100 posts over 5 months equates to 20 posts a month. That’s about 5 posts a week going on an average of 4 weeks a month. My goal was to use a moving average of 4 posts every 7 days. I actually have a calendar on my wall that I mark an “X” on the days that I accomplished a post. &lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt; sometimes I may write a post but it doesn’t get published until later, I will return to that at another time. But! To circle back, looking back at the posts on this site, it looks like I have &lt;strong&gt;20 exactly&lt;/strong&gt; including this post. Woah, that’s oddly coincidental, not planned at all. At the same time though, this recap post is a double post on this last day of the month following &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2018/01/31/to-be-or-to-do.html&quot;&gt;To Be or To Do&lt;/a&gt;. It looks like I may have slacked off a bit at the end then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the plans going forward?&lt;/strong&gt; February is a shorter month. Recently, I’ve been out of my groove a little using my computer before work to do other work which has then impacted the amount I read and take notes. Doing that has then impacted my work day…so it seems to point to that I shouldn’t do work before work and should instead keep to my reading. 20 posts out of 28 (?) days will be more of a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a wrap! Looks like overall, not a bad goal month besides tailing off at the end. It looks like a good foundation to go into February with which will be a bit more challenging. I’m looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Post inspired from: &lt;strong&gt;Ego is the Enemy&lt;/strong&gt; by Ryan Holiday&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Which do you want: to be somebody or to do something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning’s chapter of &lt;strong&gt;Ego is the Enemy&lt;/strong&gt; posed a solid question - to be or to do? This quote comes from John Boyd, a colonel in the Air Force where he posed it to his students and officers. “To be somebody or to do something. In life there is often a roll call. That’s when you have to make a decision” - John Boyd (31).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryan Holiday, author of &lt;strong&gt;Ego is the Enemy&lt;/strong&gt;, paints this picture for us: to be somebody is easy - what matters is &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, your reputation, inclusion, etc. To be somebody is a easier path - you focus on talking, climbing the corporate ladder, following the path that others before you have made, “pay your dues, check your boxes…and leave things essentially as they are” (33). Or, you can do something. If your purpose in life is something greater than being somebody, to prove something to yourself, then the path forward is different. It may be easier in the sense that you don’t have to compromise on yourself because you know what your purpose is. You are working on the &lt;em&gt;action&lt;/em&gt;, not working on a reputation. But, it will be harder because the opportunities and decisions ahead of you are then “evaluated along strict guidelines” (34). When you are working towards a purpose, the questions then become deeper and harder. Will this help me? Does this enable progress or push me back? In the words of Jocko Willink, is this &lt;strong&gt;poison&lt;/strong&gt; for me? The questions shift from “who” to “what”. No longer “who do I want to be” but instead “what do I want to accomplish”. The ego pushes for the “who” - the reputation, the attention, the talk - but if your purpose is higher than the reputation, the attention, and the talk, then the ego is the enemy and must be set aside.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Post inspired from: &lt;strong&gt;Ego is the Enemy&lt;/strong&gt; by Ryan Holiday&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember back to your first job that you ever got - like job-job. This could have been an internship in your field, apprenticeship, or a junior developer. At any point in that time period did you think to yourself “I’m not being appreciated for my work” or “I know I can do better than this”? Hello ego. Ryan Holiday talks about in &lt;strong&gt;Ego is the Enemy&lt;/strong&gt; that with those positions they are ripe for opportunity…if we can fight our ego. We are told “make your boss look good” and “help those above you.” Those phrases are putting your ego aside and putting others above yourself. That way, when the time comes people think of you as a valuable asset to the team - you put them ahead of you and they will remember that. You are helping clear the paint ahead of them while they reap the credit. In doing this, you are putting your ego aside so that you can grow yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryan Holiday throws in the last tip about clearing the path - you then decide where to go.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/26/not-for-me-now</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m throwing in the towel. After starting (aka reading the first chapter) of &lt;em&gt;Wherever You Go, There You Are&lt;/em&gt; by Jon Kabat-Zinn, I’ve decided that right now, it isn’t the right book for me. I’m not saying in the future it wont be, but right now it isn’t my focus. Now you may be thinking, why don’t you just fit it in and make it your focus? Well, because I have limits. WYGTYA (&lt;em&gt;Wherever You Go, There You Are&lt;/em&gt;) shares how to be more mindful, talks about the practice of meditation, better ways to meditate, reasons to meditate, and a ton of really good information about mindfulness. For me, right now, on this the 26th day of January, meditation is not in my top priority list. Other tasks such as getting healthy, eating well, blogging, and learning are all taking up most of my time already. Also, something I’ve struggled with in the past is having &lt;strong&gt;too much&lt;/strong&gt; on my plate so nothing gets done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In saying that, I will have to remove the book from my list. Well not remove it, but, a small line will go through it crossing it off and symbolizing I did not finish it. Maybe in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Sharing Ideas Part 2</title>

   <updated>2018-01-25T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/25/share-ideas-part-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the first post on this topic, I posed an idea for using voice-enabled devices to create art. Today I’ll be sharing another idea I’ve pondered (and may have coded a little on).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Reddit, there exists a little bot that’s a reminder bot. Basically, any user can say something like “Remind me in 2 years to X” and the reminder bot will reply confirming that reminder, and then, in 2 years, it will resurface that post. On Twitter, people post similar things “I could use a reminder” or “remind me in a year to make sure I’ve done X” or any other variation of the reminder phrase. Here’s the idea: a simple Twitter bot that does the same thing as the Reddit one - it just retweets that original tweet to remind that person of whatever they wanted!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever wanted to dive into the world of Twitter bots, that would be a fun one. The question now is, would you need a separate database to hold these reminders? Probably…could be a simple JSON structure for each day and then the ID of the tweet to retweet. Then all it does it is checks to see if today exists in that structure, if it does, retweet all the data objects inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple…right?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Is It Possible?</title>

   <id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/23/is-it-possible</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thoughts from finishing: &lt;strong&gt;Living with a Seal: 31 Days Training with the Toughest Man on the Plane&lt;/strong&gt; by Jesse Itzler&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before picking up &lt;em&gt;Living with a Seal&lt;/em&gt;, I expected it to be a “note-taking” book as I call them: books where I actively write down thoughts I while reading. Don’t get me wrong, there are a ton of valuable lessons in &lt;em&gt;Living with a Seal&lt;/em&gt;, but, it isn’t quite the same as &lt;em&gt;Algorithms to Live By&lt;/em&gt; if you know what I’m saying. I flew through &lt;em&gt;Living with a Seal&lt;/em&gt; because I couldn’t put it down. The writing, the order, the humor - all of it crafted an entertaining book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I’m going to be honest, when I finished the book I had one burning question: &lt;strong&gt;Is that really possible?&lt;/strong&gt; What I mean by that is that what Jesse Itzler went through with SEAL almost seems borderline &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt;. To give a short recap (provided in the back of his book), over 31 days they completed: running 222.5 miles, 6488 pushups, 236 pull-ups, 957 sit-ups, 200 burpees, 800 jumping jacks, 50 box jumps, 150 flutter kicks, and 14 fireman carries. On the 27th day, Jesse completed 1000 pushups in a day. The book also talks about how SEAL could do many, many, many more of each of those exercises. The numbers fail to mention weaing weighted vests, how they shaved over a minute off the running pace, and the conditions they were in (December in New York).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the “is it possible?” question isn’t really meant to challenge the validity of the book - that isn’t what the question is direct at. The question is for myself. It’s for us, you and me. While reading the book it, it starts to implant a small thought into your own brain: can I do that? It would be extreme to invite someone in to our own home for 30 days to live with us 24/7. But, what about those pushups? What about those pull-ups? There was no “failure” living with SEAL - it takes as long as it is going to take to complete the exercise. So the next question I have for myself and for you is - why aren’t I? Why aren’t you? Jesse can do it. SEAL can do it. Many other people can do it. There are no excuses and the only left to do is &lt;strong&gt;to do it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what am I going to do about it? Well, it starts with pushups.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Dope Addiction</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/21/the-dope-addiction.html"/>
   <updated>2018-01-21T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/21/the-dope-addiction</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This isn’t any actual drug I’m talking about being addicted to today, this is a feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m going to run a marathon this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m launching a startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m planning on traveling to Europe this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve heard those phrases before. You have actually probably stated a phrase like that before - a big-idea phrase - one that will attract some attention to you. Those phrases where you share an idea you have or a goal you have to someone else, you know those? Could be as simple as “I wake up at 5:30AM” all the way to “I’m going to run in the Boston Marathon”, but everyone has at some point in their life declared their big plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then we get hit with it - that small hit of dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow, in proclaiming our big plan, we get a high. A high that tells us “yes, that is a good thing.” Every January I am faced with this struggle - I oftentimes keep my goals and resolutions personal and secret because I don’t want to become somebody who said they would do something and failed. But, sharing it is addicting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just by uttering a phrase, we can release dopamine into our brain that &lt;em&gt;makes us feel good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what happens when something makes us feel good? Well, we want to do it again and again and again. Now, I’m not psychologist or psychiatrist or any doctor of any sort, no where close, but sometimes I worry others may be too addicted to this rush. You may recognize it in some of your peers - the ones who always have the big ideas but never seem to go anywhere. The ones who share plans of what they want to do but then the next time you see them, they have a totally different idea. They share a new idea with you that they are going to do. Then, a couple hours later over some drinks, they share another idea of what they are going to do. Like I said, I’m not a doctor, but it would &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; like there may exist an addiction - an addiction to sharing an idea and then the sequential dopamine hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s the cure then?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the words of Jocko Willink - &lt;strong&gt;get after it.&lt;/strong&gt; Otherwise, you may spend more of your life talking the talk but not walking the walk.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Myth of Unlimited Vacation Days</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/20/unlimited-vacation.html"/>
   <updated>2018-01-20T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/20/unlimited-vacation</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Post inspired from: &lt;strong&gt;Algorithms to Live By&lt;/strong&gt; by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Job Perks:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Unlimited Vacation Days&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that not something all of us want to see when applying for jobs? &lt;em&gt;Unlimited Vacation Days&lt;/em&gt; - it sure does sound perfect. But what if I told you that oftentimes that in the companies that implement the unlimited vacation day policy, employees actually take &lt;strong&gt;less&lt;/strong&gt; vacation time. Sounds impossible right? How could that be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blame it on Game Theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I can’t say that all people are like this, many people I know are so I think it applies well, but when we are working at a job what is one of the main goals? Besides delivering good work and pleasing your boss, &lt;em&gt;most people&lt;/em&gt; I know have a larger goal in mind: getting a promotion and moving up. We all want to move up, right? More pay, more benefits, more responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we, individually, are trying to move up in our positions and work towards that next promotion, well, so are your coworkers. Your coworkers also want that promotion, they also want more responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well that’s where the problem with Unlimited Vacation Days comes into view. When you have unlimited vacation days, what do you want to do? Well, if you are gunning for that promotion, you are trying to seem “better” than your coworkers. You want your boss to know you are working harder, spending more time, contributing more, and encompassing yourself more with work &lt;em&gt;more than your coworkers.&lt;/em&gt; Not a lot more, just a little more to have that edge. Say your coworker takes a 14 day vacation - well, to prove you are “harder working”, you may one up it a little and just take a 12 day vacation. “I’m working harder and giving more to the company” you may think. You have that edge.
…But then flip it for your coworkers. Your coworker also wants that edge - so when they see you taking a 12 day vacation, well they just might only take a 10 day vacation. And then you see your coworker taking a 10 day vacation and think “shoot, they are doing better than me, I need to work harder”, so you take less vacation. When you take less vacation that means that your coworkers take less vacation…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, there is the problem. No one is taking enough vacation. Since everyone is vying to get that promotion, to get better, to “climb the ladder”, the Unlimited Vacation Days are not being used. You don’t want to come off as a slacker or not putting in your time, and, in doing so, everyone ends up taking less time off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the solution? I don’t have it - maybe a required minimum to start. Otherwise, those 2-week policies aren’t looking too bad anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Relax Your Decisions a Little</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/18/relaxation-algorithm.html"/>
   <updated>2018-01-18T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/18/relaxation-algorithm</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Post inspired from: &lt;strong&gt;Algorithms to Live By&lt;/strong&gt; by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many decisions do we face in our lifetime that don’t seem to have an answer? Every day we face hundreds if not thousands of decisions that guide us in a certain direction. But what about those hard questions? Those big life questions we are ask ourselves at some point?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What do I want to do with my life? What kind of career do I want? Where do I want to live? How can I succeed?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily for us, there’s a technique in the computer science world to help us out. Mathematically speaking, there is no way for you to determine all possible scenarios of some of the questions above to determine the best possible - it would take too long. That is where &lt;strong&gt;Constraint Relaxation&lt;/strong&gt; comes in to help us out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Constraint Relaxation&lt;/strong&gt;, you “remove some of the problem’s constraints and set about solving the problem [you] wish [you] had” (173). For the questions above then, you would imagine them in a different light:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What would you do if you weren’t afraid?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;What would you do if you couldn’t fail&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;What would you do if you didn’t have to worry about money?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may see those questions on motivational posters, Instagram posts, used in public speeches, and a multitude of other places. Those questions are using the constraint relaxation technique to remove one of the problem’s constraints to make the decision seemingly easier. In a connection to another author and public figure I follow, Tim Ferriss has mention a couple times in his podcast and publicly a technique that he uses: &lt;em&gt;What would it look like if this was easy?&lt;/em&gt; As you can see, Tim is relaxation the constraints in whatever problem he is facing and making it “easy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time you look at a typographic motivational poster asking you what you would do if X or without Y, remember, there’s some Math and Computer Science to explain that question.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Getting started with MySQL</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/17/getting-started-with-mysql.html"/>
   <updated>2018-01-17T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/17/getting-started-with-mysql</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Want to learn how to use MySQL? This post will share how to get started with the basics!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;before-you-start&quot;&gt;Before You Start&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I am using a Mac, so all my commands and applications are for a Mac. If you would like to understand how to use it on Windows, let me know on &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/kevinguebert&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and I can try and help you out!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is coming from a developer, so this will be done using the command line. If you are looking for a more “one click install”, visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/&quot;&gt;mysql.com&lt;/a&gt; to download.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-started&quot;&gt;Getting started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, most Mac computers do not come with MySQL installed, so we actually need to install it on our computer. So let’s start with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;installation&quot;&gt;Installation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;install-mysql&quot;&gt;Install MySQL&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We are going to be using &lt;a href=&quot;https://brew.sh/&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; to help us with the installation. If you do not already use it, I would recommend learning about it and discovering how powerful it is.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let’s open up the terminal and paste the line below to install Homebrew:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/ruby -e &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Note, you may need to close and restart your terminal for this next step, but let’s make sure it works by typing in:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;brew info mysql
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hopefully that works successfully! If it does, you should see something like below:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mysql: stable 5.7.20 (bottled), devel 8.0.3-rc
Open source relational database management system
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now to install MySQL, all we need to do is:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;brew install mysql
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congratulations! That was a quick and easy way to install MySQL! However, for those keen eyed out there, you will see in the output from the previous command that there are some recommended steps for us to take.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you would like to make your MySQL connection more secure on your computer, you can run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mysql_secure_installation.&lt;/code&gt; This will ask you to change the root password for MySQL because when it originally installed, it did not supply one. That is up to you!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, you will see at the bottom of the output these lines:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;To have launchd start mysql now and restart at login:
  brew services start mysql
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  mysql.server start
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above it states you can either have MySQL running all the time or start it only when you need it. I personally use MySQL more often than not, so I ran &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew services start mysql&lt;/code&gt;. If you don’t use it as much, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mysql.server start&lt;/code&gt; works just as well - just make sure to remember to start it each time you need it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;install-sequelpro&quot;&gt;Install SequelPro&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite admin tools to work with MySQL. Visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sequelpro.com/&quot;&gt;SequelPro.com&lt;/a&gt; to download.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;setting-up-sequelpro-and-mysql&quot;&gt;Setting up SequelPro and MySQL&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have SequelPro installed and MySql running (from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mysql.server start&lt;/code&gt;), we can connect!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go ahead and open up SequelPro on your computer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You should be on a screen where in the top middle is says “Enter connection details below, or choose a favorite” - we are going to go ahead and enter connection details.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the input boxes in the middle, make sure “Standard” is select. Then you can input the follow:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Host: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Username: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;root&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If you entered a password, put that in the next field.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go ahead and click “Connect” and you should be connected!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;working-with-sequelpro&quot;&gt;Working with SequelPro&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we are connected, we could start working with some data! For this next part of the tutorial, we are going to use some dummy data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Head one over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mockaroo.com/&quot;&gt;https://www.mockaroo.com/&lt;/a&gt;, change the “Format” to SQL and also check “include create table”. Click “Download Data” but also make note of the “Table Name” - it is mostly likely “MOCK_DATA”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Head back to SequelPro and go to Database-&amp;gt;Add Database&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the Database Name field, make sure you have the same name as from mockaroo.com - most likely “MOCK_DATA”. When you have confirmed that, click “Add”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Next up, go to File-&amp;gt;Import&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find the file you downloaded in step 1 from Mockaroo and click “Open”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After it has imported, you should see on the left hand side under “Tables” your table of “Mock Data”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you click on the “Content” tab in the top of SequelPro, you should be able to see all the data within the MOCK_DATA table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations you have successfully setup and installed MySQL!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you want to query the database, click on the “Query” tab in the top and type in your command. For out data, if you do &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SELECT * from MOCK_DATA WHERE gender=&quot;male&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, you should get all the male results!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have your own sql file? Go ahead and create a new database and import your data!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Sharing Ideas</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/16/sharing-ideas.html"/>
   <updated>2018-01-16T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/16/sharing-ideas</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One thing I love being a part of is getting an idea and seeing how far you can take it. Over the past couple years, I’ve been fortunate enough to participate in a couple of these ideas that broke the barrier between idea and product. My favorite one was Activity Buzz - a service that helped parents find the best activities for their kids. Unfortunately, it didn’t quite pan out. But, in the semi-failure, many lessons were learned so I’d count it as a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideas though are just ideas unless you act on them. They sit in your brain or on a piece of paper or in a spreadsheet for eternity unless some action is taken. The number of times I’ve spent a hours going down a hole and then not act on that idea is…countless. In college I even semi-designed something that never came to fruition. This past year, a friend and myself even submitted our idea to a bootcamp. Most ideas though, well they go in the long list of “that would be cool.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today, I’m sharing one of those ideas!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;draw-with-your-voice&quot;&gt;Draw With Your Voice&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back maybe last year or the year before that, Reddit had an application where users could color in pixels on a white canvas on the internet. It would all depend on how many users were drawing, consistency, frequency, and many other factors. Often times, if you wanted to draw something, someone else would come in and override what you just drew with their own drawing. Pixel by pixel, different images emerged in different spots on this canvas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thought: what if you could do that with your voice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While playing with Alexa, I wondered how cool it would be if everyone who had an Alexa was able to “draw” on a shared canvas on the internet but with the restriction of only being able to saw what you want. Commands like “draw a line from the top left to the bottom right” or “draw a circle in the middle” were some example commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be difficult though - getting commands from voice data points to X,Y positions on a canvas would be…tricky to say the least. But, in a skewed way of thinking (and with some technical prowess), you could imagine that people could then “paint” or “create art” with their voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have any thoughts about this? Let me know &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/kevinguebert&quot;&gt;@kevinguebert&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Listen to this podcast - Tim Ferriss interviews Terry Crews</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/14/terry-crews-podcast.html"/>
   <updated>2018-01-14T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/14/terry-crews-podcast</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve found my favorite podcast of this year. Granted we are only 14 days into it, but if I were to recommend any podcast right now to anyone, I would highly recommend Tim Ferriss’ interview of Terry Crews title &lt;a href=&quot;https://tim.blog/2017/12/20/terry-crews-how-to-have-do-and-be-all-you-want/&quot;&gt;Terry Crews — How to Have, Do, and Be All You Want&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll admit, I didn’t know too much about Terry Crews going into the podcast, but, he the way he talks and shares is spell-bounding. I won’t share too much of the details, but one part of the interview Terry Crews talks about how if you want to have something or be something, then &lt;strong&gt;be&lt;/strong&gt; it. His example is this - if you want to be rich, then right now, you are rich. Be rich. So the question you ask yourself is, &lt;strong&gt;what would a rich person do?&lt;/strong&gt;. Or if you want to be a writer - be a writer. What would a writer do? Well a writer would start writing every day, start taking notes, and publish a book. You are a writer. You are rich. So be it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Finding Your Peak Time - My Morning Routine</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/12/morning-routine.html"/>
   <updated>2018-01-12T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/12/morning-routine</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you Goole or search on Medium for “morning routine”, you are bound to get thousands of pages of people describing their morning routine and why it is the best one out there. From article titles like “What the 5 Most Successful People Do Every Morning” to “Do these 10 Things Every Morning for Maximum Productivity”, there are slew of habits, actions, and routines that people are willing to talk about and prescribe you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, over the past 2 years of working on how I spend my morning, I have decided on one main point: &lt;em&gt;you pick the best way to start your day that fits you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I’ve come to that is from interacting with people and talking with them - everyone is different. Case in point: night owls will not benefit from waking up before dawn and getting started. Night owls work best in the silence of the night when everyone else is asleep. Some people get up and read to invigorate the brain, others meditate to calm the brain, some people journal, others hit the gym. What I’m trying to say is to experiment to find out what works best with you - take a hard look at when your maximum productivity is, when you feel the best, and then capture that energy by creating routines that build that fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what works best for me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I’ve come to realize and understand that I am more of a morning person. 100% I love waking up before others in the quiet of the morning, having my coffee, and starting the day with decisions I make instead of other’s. That means I am usually in bed pretty early but that is a different post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what a typical morning looks like for me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5:30AM Wakeup alarm by Jocko Willink (See &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/01/07/using-sleep-full-potential.html&quot;&gt;Sleep &amp;amp; Discipline to learn more&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Downstairs to start my kettle for coffee &amp;amp; I make sure to have about half of my Nalgene of water&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aeropress Coffee (if you are looking for a good, quick, coffee system, I highly recommend Aeropress. Learning about it and the science behind it was enlightening)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get out my regular looking journal - it is one of those notebooks you see in school, spiral bound, where if you mess up the spirals then the thing is a pain - mine right now is blue and wide ruled. Sometimes I have college ruled, but I like wide as it seems to be the right amount of time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With my coffee and journal, I usually spend on average 25-30 minutes journaling. This equates to one page (front and back) in my journal. Journal topics have a wide range, but the main focus is to get thoughts out of my head and on to paper so they don’t bother me any longer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Next is a choice: I either write a post like this to share what I have learned &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; I read for another 45 minutes and take notes so I learn more thus share more posts like this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Around 6:45/7:00 is the first time I check my phone. I try and go as long as possible without checking it - around this time is usually when I start making breakfast and thus would like some music&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;7:00-7:40, breakfast, preparing for work, making my lunch - the usual morning activities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;7:40 - on my bike, headed to work - I am fortunate enough to be able to bike every morning - it gets my heart rate up a little, that fresh morning air, and it’s pretty quiet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8:00 - at my desk, starting the work day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one point in there that I would like to highlight and share more - &lt;strong&gt;don’t check your phone.&lt;/strong&gt; This one I have come to enjoy the most. Why? Well because when you check your phone, you are then subject to the asks of others. Others could be text messages or phone calls, but it could also be Tweets, Likes, News Updates, and more. This immediately changes the focus from yourself to the call and ask of others. Most people, myself included, have their minds crowded and jumbled up then - it is hard to journal when you have the other apps and notifications in your mind. This also has the dual side effect of getting you out of your bed - if instead you just roll over and check your phone - you can get lost in the scroll for way to much time. Get out of bed and get after it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try the no-phone rule out. Maybe it’s the first 30 minutes of your morning just drinking coffee in silence. Or maybe it’s just 10 minutes every morning. I believe it will help start your day by allowing you to make decisions about how you want your day to go instead of being a slave to the call of others.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Explore/Exploit Algorithm in Decisions & Regret</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/10/explore-exploit.html"/>
   <updated>2018-01-10T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/10/explore-exploit</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Post inspired from: &lt;strong&gt;Algorithms to Live By&lt;/strong&gt; by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explore/Exploit:&lt;/strong&gt; In the explore phase, we &lt;em&gt;gather&lt;/em&gt; all the information, and the exploit phase is &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; that information you have to make the best decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;decisions&quot;&gt;Decisions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we look at the Explore/Exploit algorithm, we can see that an old phrase is actually has some truth behind it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The grass is always greener on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have all heard that saying before, but, did you know that there is some mathematically proof that supports it? If you do not have much data, then the unknown has a higher chance of success, even if we expect it to be no different, or “if it’s just as likely to be worse” (41). Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths state it as the “untested rookie is worth more than the veteran of seemingly equal ability, precisely because we know less about him.” Therein lies the kicker though - once we have enough data, then we make a decision based with the provided data that could possibly change the scenario around. So next draft you see - whether it is football, baseball, basketball, or any sport - remember that the rookies getting the huge contracts are getting the huge contracts because of the chance that they are the best (a higher chance of success).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;regret&quot;&gt;Regret&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“To try and fail is at least to learn; to fail to try is to suffer the inestimable loss of what might have been” - Chester Barnard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to look at Explore/Exploit is to frame it in the light of trying to live “&lt;strong&gt;a life with minimal regret&lt;/strong&gt;” (43). The authors share a story about how Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com, took the risk of moving from his well paying job to the online bookstore. They quote him as saying it was an easy decision. Why? Well Bezos used the idea of living a life with minimal regret and did an exercise with it: he imagined himself at 80 years old and then thought back on his life and knew he wanted to have minimal regrets. In this exercise, he knew that not taking the risk would lead to regret, thus, he took the risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers have then spent years looking to find a way to guarantee minimal regret - the most famous algorithm is called the &lt;strong&gt;Upper Confidence Bound.&lt;/strong&gt; This algorithm makes a decision not based on what has performed best in the past, but what &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; perform the best in the future. To explain it, the authors share that “if you have never been to a restaurant before, then for all you know it could be great. Even if you have gone there once or twice, and tried a couple of dishes, you might not have enough information to rule out the possibility that it could yet prove better” (44).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Upper Confidence Bound algorithm has a sense of optimism about it - the optimism that what you are trying could be the best. “By focusing on the best that an option could be, these algorithms give a boost to possibilities we know less about” (45). What does that mean for you and me? If we think about the world in the terms of these algorithms, then “you should be excited to meet new people and try new things - to assume the best about them, in the absence of evidence to the contrary” (45) because the chances of finding the best that way are better than not even trying at all.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Look-Then-Leap Rule - Explained</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/09/look-then-leap.html"/>
   <updated>2018-01-09T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/09/look-then-leap</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Post inspired from: &lt;strong&gt;Algorithms to Live By&lt;/strong&gt; by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loop-Then-Leap Rule:&lt;/strong&gt; “You set a predetermined amount of time for ‘looking’ - that is, exploring your options, gathering data - in which you categorically don’t choose anyone, no matter how impressive. After that point, you enter the ‘leap’ phase, prepared to instantly commit to anyone who outshines the best applicant you saw in the look phase.” (13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;explanation&quot;&gt;Explanation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scenario: You are interviewing for a new secretary and want to pick the best applicant. Once you have passed on a candidate, you cannot go back and pick them. You are interviewing at random.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-applicants&quot;&gt;1 Applicants&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hire them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-applicants&quot;&gt;2 Applicants&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 2 applicants, you have a 50/50 shot at hiring the best one. Either pick the first one, or, if you don’t, you have to pick the second one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-applicants&quot;&gt;3 Applicants&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you have 3 applicants, ranked as the best being 1, second best being 2, and worst being 3. With 3 applicants, there are 6 possible scenarios in which you can interview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1-2-3 (that is: best, second best, worst)&lt;br /&gt;
1-3-2&lt;br /&gt;
2-1-3&lt;br /&gt;
2-3-1&lt;br /&gt;
3-1-2&lt;br /&gt;
3-2-1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the 3 applicants, &lt;em&gt;we can actually do just as well as we did with just 2 applicants - a 50/50 shot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we see the first applicant, we don’t have any baseline information so we pass up on them to gather more data (the “look”) phase. When we see the final applicant, we only have one person so we have to pick them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the second option, there is more room. With the “Look-Then-Leap” Rule - &lt;strong&gt;if the second option is better than the first one, then you leap. If it is not, then you move to the next one.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s visualize this - remember, you are on the second candidate because the first candidate was your “look” - or information gathering:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 -&lt;u&gt; 2 &lt;/u&gt;- 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, we have already passed up on the best candidate (1), so this would be a Failure.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 -&lt;u&gt; 3 &lt;/u&gt;- 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the one above, we have already passed up on the best candidate (1), so also a Failure.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 -&lt;u&gt; 1 &lt;/u&gt;- 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, the second candidate is better than the first one (1 is better than 2), so you would leap on this candidate - Success!
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 -&lt;u&gt; 3 &lt;/u&gt;- 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second candidate is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; better than the first one (3 is worse than 2), so you would then move on to the 3rd candidate. The 3rd candidate is better than the first one, so you would then leap - Success!
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 -&lt;u&gt; 1 &lt;/u&gt;- 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, the second candidate is better than the first one (1 is better than 3), so you would leap on this candidate - Success!
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 -&lt;u&gt; 2 &lt;/u&gt;- 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this last scenario, the second candidate is better than the first candidate (2 is better than 3), so that means we would leap by the rules. Unfortunately that means we miss out on the last candidate, the 1 - Failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the data above we have 3 successes and 3 failures - thus a 50/50 chance when we have 3 candidates - tada!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successes: [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2]&lt;br /&gt;
Failures: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [3,2,1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To continue on an enumerate more candidates - 4, 5, 6, etc. - the place where you end up drawing the line between looking and leaping is actually 37% (the 37% Rule).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;37-rule&quot;&gt;37% Rule&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When choosing the best candidate, you only have a 37% chance of hiring the best possible applicant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works:&lt;/strong&gt; You look at the first 37% of the applicants, not choosing any of them, then after that, leap for anyone that is better than all those you have seen so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time you are making a decision over a large amount of data and you are trying to decide the “best”, it may be worth it to consider this algorithm!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Who's Fault Is It?</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/08/whos-fault-is-it.html"/>
   <updated>2018-01-08T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/08/whos-fault-is-it</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I love my routine. I love having a plan, knowing what the future holds, and knowing what the expectations are for me. I may be addicted to it. The feeling of moving forward, of progress, towards making something (usually myself) better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why, however, that interruptions to my routine can cause rifts in my mood. These interruptions often come in the form of other people - friends, family, coworkers, etc. - that have a different agenda or a different plan or idea. Instead of only focusing on myself, now I have to take into consideration other people’s wants and needs. This often times breaks my routine. Instead of going grocery shopping on a Sunday and planning my week out, I’m watching NFL football at a brewery eating out. Instead of getting some exercise or meal prepping, I’m hanging out on a couch with other people not doing that. I have come to loathe the unplanned/sitting around a couch doing nothing with no plan/browsing the phone moments. I would rather be by myself moving in some direction (hopefully making forward progress) instead of sitting around with my friends with no plan. And when I am in those “less desirable” situations, I get frustrated, moody, anxious, and angry. I get short with my phrases and retreat into silence. I start blaming others for interrupting my time and my precious routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the thing is, it isn’t their fault. It isn’t my friend’s fault, my family’s, or my coworker’s. They have no control over my routine, they have no control over my reactions. More often than not, they don’t even know what my routine and goals are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is my fault. The salty mood, that anxious feeling, that frustration I’m building up - it’s all because of me. I am responsible for not making my routine happen. No one else. Me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I need to meet my macros today and hit my calorie goal? I have to plan for that. I can’t just assume food and nutrient-dense foods will fall out of the sky. I am responsible for what I eat and when I eat. We are going for a hike and in the morning I usually have a protein-rich snack before lunch? Well I need to plan to have that on the hike or an alternate later. I go to a restaurant and order something that isn’t in MyFitnessPal? I need to take note of the ingredients and log them in manually. I know I won’t have time on Sunday to go to the grocery store? I need to go on Thursday night and plan ahead for the upcoming week instead of waiting for late Sunday night or later in the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These problems are my responsibility. Other people do not have control or know what I want to do unless I voice them or make them a priority. My ego is clouding my judgment and controlling my mood when in reality, ego is the problem. My routine and goals are not hard - they don’t require me to dedicate hours every day to meet some goal. They are small, incremental, that allow me to grow and progress every day. I am responsible for making sure that I progress every day, no one else. Me.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Sleep & Discipline</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/07/using-sleep-full-potential.html"/>
   <updated>2018-01-07T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/07/using-sleep-full-potential</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Post inspired from: &lt;strong&gt;Discipline Equals Freedom Field Manual&lt;/strong&gt; by Jocko Willink&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleep can be elusive. It can be frustrating. It can be restless. It can be tiring. But sleep can also be fruitful and it can re-energize. Everyone needs to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to be frank with you: I am usually in bed by 9:00PM and asleep before 10:00PM every night. I try and read something before I go to bed to help calm the mind, so sometimes it is closer to 10:00PM, other times I’m asleep right at 9. I love it. While I am very fortunate to be able to sleep in a comfy bed every night, sometimes I struggle with sleep - falling asleep, staying asleep, and, maybe most importantly, getting out of bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many factors seem to effect the quality of sleep - Jocko Willink in &lt;strong&gt;Discipline Equals Freedom Field Manual&lt;/strong&gt; offers the argument that “if you are in good physical condition, eating clean, and have a clear mind” (103) then sleep comes faster, easier, and requires less of it. Right there is &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; benefit of working out, eating well, and calming one’s mind (through reading, journaling, meditation, etc). One quote that really stands out to me from this section is that Jocko “choose(s) not to sleep in. I don’t give in to the temptation of the warm blankets and soft pillow. I mobilize the will to get me out of bed and into the game.” (109) &lt;em&gt;Mobilize the will.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The follow pages are then a good introduction into how Jocko the Navy Seal operates - he is up at 4:30AM and every morning posts a picture of his watch showing 4:34AM on Twitter. Why so early? Well if you wake up at 4:30, work out like he says, and start the day, then you will most likely be very, very tired by 9:30PM to fall asleep easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“… a vast majority of the world is still sleep. You aren’t. You are up getting after it. The world is yours when you are up before the enemy” (104)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do you think? 4:30AM every morning, &lt;strong&gt;even weekends&lt;/strong&gt;. Do you think you can do it? Get after it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure to follow &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/@jockowillink&quot;&gt;Jocko on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to see his 4:34AM tweets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pro-tip from Joe: Jocko has an album out call &lt;strong&gt;Psychological Warfare&lt;/strong&gt; on Google Play and iTunes where the first track is called “Wake up and Get After it”. Set that bad boy as your alarm and it will be tough staying in bed with Jocko’s voice right next to you.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Stoicism & Discipline Equals Freedom</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/04/the-best-for-yourself.html"/>
   <updated>2018-01-04T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/04/the-best-for-yourself</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am one day in and 39 pages deep into &lt;strong&gt;Discipline Equals Freedom Field Manual&lt;/strong&gt;, and I would already highly recommend it to anyone. This morning I came across a couple passages that I wanted to share that I believe relate very much to Stoicism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How long are you going to wait before you demand the best for yourself? - Epictetus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above question is short and simple, but initiates a deeper question and conversation I can have with myself. Jocko Willink, author of &lt;strong&gt;Discipline Equals Freedom Field Manual&lt;/strong&gt; goes even deeper into these types of questions. He states that “knowledge is the ultimate weapon” (28) and the path to gaining knowledge is to “Question &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. Don’t accept anything as truth.” The rest of the page talks then about external questions that we may face every day - words we don’t know, concepts we may not understand, etc. But, the more important questions are the ones like the quote above. Jocko shares it as “Question yourself every day.” All the time, question my actions, my thoughts, my progress, my learning. Question everything about me. And they are very simple questions, but like above, very powerful. Below is my favorite excerpt from this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Is &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; what I want to be? &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt;? Is &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; all I’ve got – is this everything I can give? Is &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; going to be &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; life? Do I &lt;em&gt;accept&lt;/em&gt; that? - Jocko Willink (29)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What bombshells of questions. Why? Well because we all know that we can do better. I could feel it in myself while reading those questions that I am not giving it all I’ve got. I know I can do better and Jocko challenges us to fight back and not accept it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten pages later, Jocko provides us hope with these questions. I am not going to lie, after reading &lt;strong&gt;Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future&lt;/strong&gt;, I actually felt a bit discouraged. Elon Musk seems to be so far and above everyone else that some people even revere him in a god-like way. Reading about all his accomplishments, his challenges, and his successes, I couldn’t help but reflect on myself a little and compare some of what I’ve done to him. Foolish, I know, but still in the back of my mind, and also a very negative exercise. In his chapter on “Nature vs. Nurture,” Jocko simplifies it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is not about nature or nuture: It is about choice. The people who are successful &lt;em&gt;decide&lt;/em&gt; they are going to be successful. They make that choice. - Jocko Willink (39)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he provides more hope - “It is never too late to make that choice…Choose to make yourself smarter and stronger and healthier…Don’t let nature or nuture make you. Choose to Make. Your. Self.” (39) Next time then when I start comparing myself to others, start looking at successful people, I have to remind myself that it is a choice. A choice that I can also make.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Behat and JS? Go CasperJS</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/03/behat-and-casper.html"/>
   <updated>2018-01-03T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/01/03/behat-and-casper</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today while writing tests (shocking, I know), I came across an interesting and unknown (at the time) scenario. For the site, I wanted to test and make sure a certain element was showing up on the page. At the time, I was writing Behat tests to do some functionality and the tests are very simple to write, so I decided to try and create a simple test for my element. &lt;em&gt;Usually&lt;/em&gt; this is pretty straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Given I am on &quot;/&quot; #the homepage
Then I should see &quot;.ad-block&quot; element
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see above, I am checking to make sure an ad is showing up on the page. &lt;em&gt;However&lt;/em&gt; the problem is that the ads do not populate on first page load. They have to send a request to get the ads and populate them. So, this means for Behat, it is &lt;strong&gt;not waiting&lt;/strong&gt; for those ads to load! The driver I am using is the Goutte driver, so any chance at creating a FeatureContext is not possible with javascript. Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Given I am on &quot;/&quot;
And I wait 4 seconds
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what I learned today! Luckily, Behat is our &lt;strong&gt;Behavior Driven Development&lt;/strong&gt; testing framework, but we also use CasperJS for our testing. In fact, there were already tests written for other ads on the site. The more you know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in college studying for my degree, I took a couple classes on design, prototyping, and building interfaces. One topic or phrase that often came up in the early lessons on prototyping and design was the idea of “Wizard of Oz.grb” In short terms, this means that you prototype an app or design without actually making it fully work. This could be as simple as a powerpoint presentation where you “tapped” on certain areas of the slide that made it “look” like you were interacting with an app, but in reality, you were just advancing to the next slide. Or it could be a bit more intense - instead of creating a full-fledged mobile application, it could be easier to prototype in HTML and CSS to make it &lt;strong&gt;look&lt;/strong&gt; like you had a fully functioning app. Prototypes in this stage are often used to attract customers, gain feedback, and look for improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future&lt;/strong&gt;, I learned that Elon Musk and Tesla also used similar practices for the Model S sedan. Ashlee Vance states that at a press event in March of 2009, the car that was shown (from a difference), was “Wizard of Oz”-ed  to “remind people that Teslas had a credible plan to make electric cars more mainstream…” Bruce Leak, a Tesla owner at the event said in regards to the body panels and the hood that “they could just slide…right off” This car is a perfect example of prototyping and showcasing an early version of a product even though “the sedan barely held together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When building the next app then, maybe it is better to have early prototypes that don’t function fully to gain the valuable feedback or gain some momentum before the launch. Who knows, maybe it will take years to make it to market like the Model S did, but with that much feedback and refinement, it could also be a success like the Model S.&lt;/p&gt;
