After spending more time than I wanted on it, I was able to make it work for both single reference and multi-reference. This post is only about multi-reference as single-reference is actually \"easier.\"</p>\n<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p><img src=\"../../../static/content/images/2020/02/screen-shot-2020-02-21-at-9.22.09-am.png\"></p>\n<p>To do this in totality will take 4 steps. I use Google Sheets as my intermediary of choice but you can use Airtable or any other spreadsheet software.</p>\n<h4>Step 1</h4>\n<p>In my \"Lookup Spreadsheet Row in Google Sheets\", I am looking up the corresponding row to see if there are already referenced items. For a User that has multiple Posts, I would be looking up the User and return the column for Posts reference.</p>\n<p>That column will either be empty or be a string of referenced IDs like \"1234\", \"ABCD\", \"34543\"</p>\n<h4>Step 2</h4>\n<p>Here I run some Javascript to clean up what I am looking for. I have the new Post ID coming in and a list of current IDs already attached to the user.</p>\n<pre><code>let result = []\nif (inputData.articles != null &#x26;&#x26; inputData.articles.length > 0) {\n  result = inputData.articles.split(\",\");\n}\nresult.push('\"' + inputData.newArticle + '\"');\nresult = result.join(\", \");\n\noutput = [{articles: result}];\n</code></pre>\n<p>The code goes through the Post column. If there is currently data there (already has posts), it splits the string into an array from \"1234\", \"ABCD\", \"34543\" into  [\"1234\", \"ABCD\", \"34543\"].</p>\n<p>Then, with the new Post ID, I push that onto the end of the array so it then becomes [\"1234\", \"ABCD\", \"34543\", \"NEW<em>POST</em>ID\"].</p>\n<p>Lastly, because I can't have an array and actually need a string, I concatenate it all together into \"1234\", \"ABCD\", \"34543\", \"NEW<em>POST</em>ID\".</p>\n<h4>Step 3</h4>\n<p>Now I go back and update the same Google Spreadsheet with the updated posts reference. This is for next time and Post is added, it will be the correct references.</p>\n<h4>Step 4</h4>\n<p>Lastly, a PUT request to the Webflow API. I follow the documentation <a href=\"https://developers.webflow.com/#update-live-collection-item\">https://developers.webflow.com/#update-live-collection-item</a> to understand a little bit more how the request should be built and ended up with something fairly simple in Zapier.</p>\n<p>Key Points from the Screenshot below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make sure to update the {CollectionID} with your collection.</li>\n<li>The {Webflow_ID} is the ID of the Webflow item you are trying to update. In this scenario, it would be the User</li>\n<li>The fields \"name\", \"slug\", \"<em>archived\", and \"</em>draft\" are all required in the request.</li>\n<li>For the \"articles\" field (this is the Posts), we want to pass in the Javascript output from the previous step into an array. So that is literally <code>[{Result from previous step}]</code> with the \"[ ]\" around the output. This is the format that Webflow accepts in their API</li>\n<li>Don't forget the Headers at the bottom along with your authorization token which you can find at <a href=\"https://webflow.com/dashboard/sites/%7Bwebsite%7D/integrations\">https://webflow.com/dashboard/sites/{website}/integrations</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"../../../static/content/images/2020/02/screen-shot-2020-02-21-at-9.32.32-am.png\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Updating Multi-reference Fields with Zapier & Webflow","date":"February 21, 2020","path":"/2020/02/21/updating-multireference-fields-zapier-webflow","tags":["NoCode","Apps"],"excerpt":"The native integration for updating reference fields from Zapier to Webflow doesn't work.
