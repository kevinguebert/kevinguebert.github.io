From this action item list, I looked into and completed all of them!</p>\n<p>✔️ Talk to a coworker/friend about ways to improve</p>\n<p>✔️ Research online classes and figure out the best one.</p>\n<p>In doing all of this, I've come to two new courses of action:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Look into books from the library that I can read to improve knowledge</li>\n</ol>\n<p>✔️ <em>Design it! : from programmer to software architect</em> is currently on hold at the library</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Start an online class </li>\n</ol>\n<p>✔️ Yesterday I started <a href=\"https://www.py4e.com/\">Python for Everybody</a> and completed the first chapter.</p>\n<p>With this new course, you will notice a new tag <a href=\"/tag/py4e.html\">py4e</a>(Python 4 Everybody - PY4E) where you can track any posts or updates I may have.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A New Coding Course","date":"March 23, 2018","path":"/2018/03/23/a-new-coding-course","tags":["PY4E","Coding","Personal Growth"],"excerpt":"A big lesson I have been working on learning over the past couple years is, when a problem occurs, take action as soon as possible.
