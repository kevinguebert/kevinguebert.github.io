Instead, in designing software and products, one needs to have <strong>empathy</strong> with the stakeholders. The stakeholders include everyone who is going to touch the application - owners, employees, users, IT, support, etc. When you spend time up front talking with the stakeholders and figuring out what <em>they want</em> and what their <em>goal</em> is, then you can design and architect with more data to create the best architecture possible. It does sound a little like User Experience (UX), but it takes the information into an engineering and architecture perspective that UX Designers are not as focused on.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Post inspired from: <strong>Design It!
