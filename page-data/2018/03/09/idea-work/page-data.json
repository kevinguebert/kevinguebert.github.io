Remember that feeling that you got what you started using it? I know whenever I see something that is built well I often times have a verbal \"wow\" that accompanies it.</p>\n<p>How often does that experience occur for you? If you are like me, surprisingly not that often. But what is that? In <em>Perennial Seller</em>, the first few chapters (pages really) share some insights into this exact idea. The first problem is that creators don't want to put in the work. I know I fall guilty to this - I want the output without putting in the effort. If we are to make a product truly fantastic though, it requires the struggle and the highs and lows that come with it. Secondly, people love ideas. My post <a href=\"/blog/2018/01/21/the-dope-addiction.html\">The Dope Addiction</a> echos this same idea - <em>Ideas are cheap</em>. But people love them, love talking about them, love fantasizing. I know I do. I am 100% a perfect example of both of these flaws (which take up 4 pages of a 200+ page book) - I avoid the hard work and I have a new idea every week. So how do we move past that? Well, for now I'm going to keep on reading to try and find out.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Post inspired from: <strong>Perennial Seller</strong> by Ryan Holiday.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Idea + Work","date":"March 09, 2018","path":"/2018/03/09/idea-work","tags":["Perennial Seller","Books","Personal Growth"],"excerpt":"> 'I don't want to hear your *idea*.
