To meet my goal of 100 new posts by Memorial Day, I would have to average 20 posts a month(ish). In February, I completed 13 blog posts which put me 7 behind the pace.</p>\n<p>In March, after having a bit of a lapse in the middle of the month and also including this post, I had <strong>32 blog posts</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Understanding the Data</strong>: To be honest, a bit of a surprise for me! Here are a couple notes about having 32 blog posts in March:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I successfully made up my 7 post deficit from February</li>\n<li>I am now 5 posts ahead of my planned schedule of 20 posts a month</li>\n<li>Brings my total blog posts to 65 - 35 to go before Memorial Day!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Going Forward</strong>: I'm not going to lie, the book I'm reading right now <em>Design It!</em> is not too exciting to blog about. It's very software/programming focused. However, I do have other books on the way that will provide (in my mind), better material. I do feel like I've been in more of a \"groove\" with posting though, so I would like to continue that in the month of April.</p>\n<p>Along with the design update in March, I've also added commenting to certain posts that I feel are suitable for comments. My <a href=\"/blog/2018/01/09/look-then-leap\">Look then Leap</a> post has received a fair amount of traffic so I recently added commenting there and have also received a comment! Not all posts will have comments though, it is based off of if I feel it would provide benefit.
