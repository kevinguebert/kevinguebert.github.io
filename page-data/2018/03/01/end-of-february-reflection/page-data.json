To meet my goal of 100 new posts by Memorial Day, I would have to average 20 posts a month(ish). In February, I completed <strong>13 blog posts</strong>. That puts me <strong>7 behind the pace</strong> ðŸ™ƒ. Not exactly what I am looking for.</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons/Excuses</strong>: What caused this lack of blog posts?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Less reading</li>\n<li>Completely out of town from February 1-4th</li>\n<li>Guests from February 22-27th.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But, that is more of an excuse than anything. I did not prioritize creating a blog post on those days, and right now, I'm okay with that. I believe I can make up those 7 in the next 3 months as long as I keep on track.</p>\n<p><strong>Ways to get back on track</strong>: My morning routine was shifted with the above activities. I succeed when I have my time to read in the morning and then reflect on my reading. What about days when I don't have that luxury? I should recognize that early on in the day (I have a basic idea of how my schedule will look), and then try and look for items I come across that could make a good (can be short) post. <strong><em>Something is better than nothing.</em></strong></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"End of February Reflection","date":"March 01, 2018","path":"/2018/03/01/end-of-february-reflection","tags":["Reflection","Personal Growth"],"excerpt":"February has come to a close!
