This month for my tracking, I implemented a version 1 plan to automate my tracking by using two services: <a href=\"ifttt.com\">IFTTT</a> and <a href=\"zapier.com/apps\">Zapier</a>. IFTTT is \"If this then that\" and Zapier is a very similar service more focused on the business aspect of tasks. What you can do is set up certain \"triggers\" which then create an output. The way I use it is by using the triggers to add events to a shared Google Calendar.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<p>Every time I have a workout on Strava, it creates an event on the calendar.</p>\n<p>Every time I commit code to my side projects, it will create an event.</p>\n<p>Every time I press a button on my watch, it will create an event correspoding to that button.</p>\n<p>I also use this for tracking how my \"todo\" list is coming along by using Trello. Every time I mark a card as \"done\" it adds it to the calendar.</p>\n<p>I'm only a couple days in, but if you are looking for a new way, I would recommend checking out those two services!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Accountability Tracking","date":"March 04, 2018","path":"/2018/03/04/march-tracking","tags":["Personal Growth"],"excerpt":"Curious about how to automate some of your accountability?
