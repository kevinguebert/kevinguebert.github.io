If you have been programming for a while now, you were probably taught this at one point in your history. For me, it was instilled in me in my first co-op job. Mnemonic variable naming is simple creating variable names that are indicative of the data they are holding. For example, <code>x = 40</code> is pretty basic, but if you change it to <code>hours_per_week = 40</code>, you can clearly understand that the value 4 relates to how many hours one may work in a week. If you are a new programmer and starting off, I would recommend trying to use mnemonic variable names as much as possible. It will help with debugging, sharing code, and help deliver better quality code in the end!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Coding Mnemonically","date":"March 25, 2018","path":"/2018/03/25/coding-mnemonically","tags":["PY4E","Coding"],"excerpt":"> Mnemonic: a device such as a pattern of letters, ideas, or associations that assists in remembering something.\nWhile following my [Python for Everybody](/2018/03/py4e) course, I learned about..."}}},"pageContext":{}}}
