You spend all day working a 9-5 and come home to work <em>more</em>. What pushes you to do that?</p>\n<p>Lately I've been struggling with both these scenarios. The last round in the gym and I don't dig deep, I stay comfortable. The opportunity to work on <a href=\"www.harvy.app\">Harvy</a> but instead I stay comfortable, I go to bed early. In these times, I lose my \"why.\" Why do I want to go to the gym? Why am I working out? Why do I want to build Harvy? Why am I working more?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1484069560501-87d72b0c3669?ixlib=rb-0.3.5&#x26;q=80&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;w=1080&#x26;fit=max&#x26;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ&#x26;s=8248324d302ce16e516054824000b147\">\nPhoto by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@emilymorter?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit\">Emily Morter</a> / <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit\">Unsplash</a></p>\n<p>Finding your own \"why\" is tough - I am constantly searching, refining, rebuilding, and redefining what mine is seemingly week by week. But having your \"why\" is important - it is what keeps you going when you don't want to push anymore. It wakes you up early in the morning, it keeps you up late at night, it pushes you to hit that last rep, it helps you stay focused and disciplined.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The \"why\" gives you purpose, a goal, a reason to do it incessently.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The question though is <em>how do you find your why?</em> I don't have an answer to that. I don't fully know mine so giving an all-in solution would be frivilous. It takes knowing yourself, knowing your aspirations (deep aspirations, not surface level), and knowing the kind of person you want to be. For some it may be as simple as being a better person that you were yesterday or a year ago - that definitely applies to me.</p>\n<p>A good starting point would be to write about it. It doesn't have to be every day or every morning, but take some time this weekend, make a good cup of coffee or tea, sit on a porch outside and start writing. Don't have a time limit either, write until you feel like you've gotten everything out on the page. You may not have a full-blown \"why\", but I would bet that you have a place to start.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Find Your Why","date":"July 11, 2018","path":"/2018/07/11/find-your-why","tags":["Personal Growth"],"excerpt":"*Post inspired by this morning's journal*\nWhen you are deep into a workout, whether it is your final half mile of a run, last repetition of your squat, or last minute of your AMRAP, what pushes you..."}}},"pageContext":{}}}
