From apps to websites to journals, these tools are available to help you try and keep on track with your goals. However, the one that works best for me is one you probably already have - a simple, printable calendar.</p>\n<h2>How does this work?</h2>\n<p>It is fairly simple - there exist multiple templates for calendars inside Excel or Numbers (Mac) that you can easily print off. From there, you hang it up on your wall where you will see it every day and cross off every days that you complete that calendar's task.</p>\n<p>Note:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have one calendar per goal</li>\n<li>Put them next to each other so you can see all your progress at once</li>\n<li>Get a big fat marker to cross off each day you complete that task</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Reasoning</h2>\n<p>Printing off and crossing each day off is similar to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret\">Jerry Seinfeld's Productivity Chain</a>, quotes like \"Don't skip 2 days in a row\", and every habit app where you are trying to build momentum.</p>\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<p>Below is a calendar from Numbers for the month of July. I've got 4 up in my place right now to work on - eating healthy, blogging, running, and going to the gym. At the end of the month I'll be able to reevaluate it all, see what went well, see what didn't, and then go forward with the next month.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../../static/content/images/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-03-at-9.03.58-AM.png\" alt=\"Screen-Shot-2018-07-03-at-9.03.58-AM\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Best Accountability Tracker","date":"July 03, 2018","path":"/2018/07/03/the-best-accountability-tracker","tags":["Personal Growth"],"excerpt":"There are a ton of ways to track your habits and keep yourself accountable.
