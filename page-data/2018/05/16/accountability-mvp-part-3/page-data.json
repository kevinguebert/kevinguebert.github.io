For example, on \"Exercise\" it shows what exercise I completed, how far, etc.</li>\n<li>Integration with other services (like Strava) so you dont have to actually input the data. But, that is also a nice feeling of \"checking\" off a day, maybe not.</li>\n<li>Milestones and goal setting - my goal was set towards Memorial Day, so maybe a countdown?</li>\n<li>Personal profile - create a web app and you could find an individual user like \"someurl.com/@kevinguebert\" (okay this is a bigger undertaking...)</li>\n<li>Multiple layouts</li>\n<li>Emails when someone is going \"streaking\" - highlight someone currently streaking</li>\n<li>Public/social accountability when someone misses more than 1 day in a row?
