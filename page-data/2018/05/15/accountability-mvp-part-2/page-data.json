Now, the progress may not look like much, but I've simplified it much much more coding-wise and made it more extensible.</p>\n<p>Basically what was changed is that instead of manually creating a calendar for each one, it now dynamically creates a calendar based off of a JSON (data) file. <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/kevinguebert/a31a2e8a09d7054dccca805ee05cb8f3\">You can actually view the file online</a> that I am using.
