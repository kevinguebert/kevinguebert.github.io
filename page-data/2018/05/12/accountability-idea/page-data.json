By using a Google Calendar and the two mentioned services, every time I completed a task that I set up as one I wanted to track, it would post to my calendar. Thinking more about it today, it could be fairly simple to get a service together to have a user highlight 2-3 top priority habits and create a visual system to keep them accountable. On my wall right now, I have 3 calendars set up so I can cross off the tasks I complete every day. The idea is to transfer that to a publicily accountable place.</p>\n<p>Brainstorm:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Reminder every day at user determined time to have them review their tasks</li>\n<li>A simple Google Form for them to check \"yes\" or \"no\" if completed</li>\n<li>Google Form updates a spreadsheet</li>\n<li>IFTTT/Zapier checks if a new row has been added to the spreadsheet</li>\n<li>If a habit was completed that day, update a calendar online by crossing off that day</li>\n</ol>\n<p>---- UPDATE 5:05PM ----</p>\n<p>I liked the idea.
