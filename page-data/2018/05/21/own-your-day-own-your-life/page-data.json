Marcus leads you through a journey of how he thinks your day should look - with morning exercise to get the blood flowing, with supplements, food to eat, training, etc. In this journey, he throws out some recommendations, a couple \"life hacks\", and small anecdotes about what he believes or what science says works. Some of this information I find valuable: last week I started doing a little 10-15 minute routine before I left for work to get the blood flowing and I felt great. Other things, not so much. So as with many \"self-help\", \"self-improvement\" type books, I would say this - take the information in, understand it, try it out, and <em>see if it works for you.</em> Other people prescribe up things to do every day, and for some of us, those things just might not work. That's okay! If it works for one person, doesn't mean it will have to work for you. But, that also doesn't mean you can ignore it. Experiment and learn about yourself while you learn. Maybe Marcus' prescription fits you perfectly, maybe you need to modify it a little for it to work, or maybe you understand what he is saying but follow a different mantra. All those scenarios are perfectly fine as long *as you are doing something.<strong>*Something is better than nothing</strong>, so get after it.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Post inspired by <em>Own the Day, Own Your Life</em> by Aubrey Marcus</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Own Your Day, Own Your Life","date":"May 22, 2018","path":"/2018/05/21/own-your-day-own-your-life","tags":["Own the Day, Own Your Life","Books"],"excerpt":"Note - I have not finished *Own the Day, Own Your Life* yet, these are preliminary thoughts.\nI have 125 pages left of Aubrey Marcus' book *Own the Day, Own Your Life* and I've come to a thought that..."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
