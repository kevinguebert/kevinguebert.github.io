To meet my goal of 100 new posts by Memorial Day, I would have to average 20 posts a month(ish). In February, I completed 13 blog posts which put me 7 behind the pace. In March, after having a bit of a lapse in the middle of the month and also including this post, I had 32 blog posts.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Now for April, I completed only <strong>15 blog posts</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Understanding the Data</strong>: A little bit of a bummer for April. To be honest, I don't quite have a reason for this low number of 15. Fortunately in March, I had 5 extra to give...but I didn't expect to need them all in April. My total is now 80, so I have 20 blog posts to write by Memorial Day (which is the average for each month).</p>\n<p><strong>Going Forward</strong>: May will have to be as strong as March was for me. Reading <strong>12 Rules of Life</strong> is intense, in depth, and philosophical, but that is not an excuse to not write about it or anything. Memorial Day is 28 days away, so my goal is definitely still attainable!</p>\n<p>One thing I have come to realize over the past week or so is that 5 months for a SMART goal for me is too long. I'm itching to start something new, get a refresh (or a week off), and set a new date and new goals. I already have some in mind that I'm getting excited about. A new blog CMS, new format, new types of posts, new content...all that good stuff. I also received some great feedback about my writing - <a href=\"/blog/2018/04/28/walk-out-of-woods\">Walk Out of the Woods</a> was given some praise for its rawness and original thought. Oftentimes I'm summarizing what I read that morning, but sprinkling in personal thoughts is something I can work on.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"April Review","date":"May 02, 2018","path":"/2018/05/01/april-review","tags":["Reflection","Personal Growth"],"excerpt":"April is over, May is here.
