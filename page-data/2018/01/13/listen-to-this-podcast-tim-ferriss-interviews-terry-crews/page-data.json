I won't share too much of the details, but one part of the interview Terry Crews talks about how if you want to have something or be something, then <strong>be</strong> it. His example is this - if you want to be rich, then right now, you are rich. Be rich. So the question you ask yourself is, <strong>what would a rich person do?</strong>. Or if you want to be a writer - be a writer. What would a writer do? Well a writer would start writing every day, start taking notes, and publish a book. You are a writer. You are rich. So be it.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Listen to this podcast - Tim Ferriss interviews Terry Crews","date":"January 14, 2018","path":"/2018/01/13/listen-to-this-podcast-tim-ferriss-interviews-terry-crews","tags":["Personal Growth","Recommendations"],"excerpt":"I've found my favorite podcast of this year.
