Obligers are those that <em>meet outer expectations</em> but <em>struggle with meeting inner expectations.</em> If you know someone that succeeds at work when they have tasks to do set out in front of them by their boss but that person can't seem to hit the gym even though they want to, they are probably an Obliger. Obligers can sometimes struggle with saying \"no\" to others while also being okay with letting their personal commitments slide in place of other's asks.</p>\n<p>Obligers benefit most from external accountability. Whether that is a coach, an instructor, a friend, a spouse, or an app, external accountability helps Obligers change those inner expectations into outer expectations they can hold themselves accountable for. The external accountability can be as simple as disappointing your family if you don't make it home for dinner (if you have a lot of work) or being charged a payment if you don't make a fitness class; external accountability helps Obligers meet their inner goals while also balancing their external expectations.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Famous Questioners: Tiger Woods</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Post inspired by <em>The Four Tendencies</em> by Gretchen Rubin.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Maybe You're an Obliger?","date":"April 09, 2018","path":"/2018/04/09/maybe-youre-an-obliger","tags":["The Four Tendencies","Books"],"excerpt":"> 'The Obliger is the rock of the world.
