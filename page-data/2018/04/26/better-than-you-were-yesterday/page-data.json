You are finding that the solutions to your particular problems have to be tailored to you, personally and precisely. You are less concerned with the actions of other people, because you have plenty to do yourself.\" (110)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Rule 3: Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today</strong></p>\n<p>Comparing to others consumes us. It is one thing that many of us do daily - a job, a car, a physique, money, friends, etc. Comparing ourselves to the versions of others is also detrimental and unfair. How can we take <em>one area</em> of our life and compare it to the life of someone else? That guy driving the fancy new car seems to have it all, but he could be lonely and wanting a family that you have. The woman running every day may be able to run faster and farther than you, but is struggling financially. Everyone has their own problems.</p>\n<p>In Rule 3, Dr. Peterson talks about paying attention - being more aware and opening up our eyes to the possibilities of growth. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo\">Watch this video and try it out for yourself</a>. We all do it - we have a focused view of the possibilities. \"I want that higher up position because my life will get better.\" That isn't a bad goal, but a bad reason.</p>\n<p>Dr. Peterson's solution is very simple though - <strong>\"What could I do, that I would do, to make Life a little better?\"</strong>(109) Think about that. What is one thing you could do today to make life a little better? It could be organizing your bills. It could be going for a walk. It could be messaging the people you've been putting off. The beauty of it is that if you ask yourself that question every day and follow through, then in a short amount of time you life will have improved dramatically. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=the+1%25+daily+rule&#x26;oq=the+1%25+daily+rule&#x26;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64l3.6532j0j3&#x26;sourceid=chrome&#x26;ie=UTF-8\">Others have wrote</a> similar articles about it calling it the 1% rule (<a href=\"https://www.1percentrulebook.com/launch\">someone even has a book about it</a>).</p>\n<p>Need help completing that task? You can tie a reward with it. \"If I pay all my bills, I'll grab a cup of coffee.\" Simple, yet effective (as long as you make sure to follow through on the coffee).</p>\n<p><strong>\"What could I do, that I would do, to make Life a little better?\"</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Post inspired by <em>12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos</em> by Jordan B.
