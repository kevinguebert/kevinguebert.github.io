Mapping has been a huge passion of mine so being able to implement it through code has been a blast. Harvy utilizes <a href=\"https://mapbox.com\">Mapbox</a>as the mapping provider. The reason for this over other services like Google is due to the reputation that Mapbox has as being a great developer resource for getting maps in an application. Other services like <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/routes/new\">Strava Routes</a> also use Mapbox as their provider, so I figured you can't go wrong with that. </p>\n<p>Right now the main features of this map are adding markers and creating a route for your run (or walk or bike). You can pinpoint where you would like to run and then it will show the total distance. </p>\n<p>This may seem like a small feature, but creating a route is the bases and foundation of the map and the features to come. Making sure that I implemented route making correctly was definitely a priority of mine. <a href=\"https://harvy.app/map\">Check it out and let me know what you think, any feedback is good feedback</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Integrating Maps with Harvy","date":"September 30, 2018","path":"/2018/09/30/integrating-maps-with-harvy","tags":["Coding","Technology","Harvy Dev"],"excerpt":"If you haven't checked it out yet, last week [maps were introduced to Harvy](https://harvy.app/map)[.](.)
