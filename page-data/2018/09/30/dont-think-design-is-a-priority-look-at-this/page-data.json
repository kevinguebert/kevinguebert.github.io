My \"design process\" is usually taking Bootstrap or Foundation and applying it to my latest project to get a pretty basic design. This process more or less gets the job done but never has anything that makes you say \"wow.\" For my latest project <a href=\"https://harvy.app/\">Harvy</a>, I decided I wanted to take it further than I had with any other project. What this meant was I was spending more time doing research, development, and marketing...but I still kept my generic Bootstrap theme.</p>\n<p>If you had checked out <a href=\"https://harvy.app/\">Harvy</a><em>one day ago</em>, this is what you would have seen:\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/U3okKSh.png\" alt=\"https://i.imgur.com/U3okKSh.png\">\nNow that isn't a <em>terrible</em> design. There's some hierarchy(ish), a couple images, some icons, a consistent tone (neutral colors), and a basic call out area. Pretty darn basic though - it is a Bootstrap-designed website and it looks like it. </p>\n<p>I knew that wasn't good enough though. I knew it could be better and in my heart it didn't feel like a finished product with that design. Now if you've been around IndieHackers for a bit you probably have heard of <a href=\"https://www.indiehackers.com/product/manypixels\">ManyPixels</a>, a designer service where you pay a monthly fee for designs. I was originally looking at 99designs and Upwork but decided to try out ManyPixels due to the IndieHackers creating it and the price. </p>\n<p>Let me tell you, it's worth it. If you are at all on the fence about design and can afford a month of ManyPixels, do it. Why? Check out version 2.0 of <a href=\"https://harvy.app/\">Harvy</a>:\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/rJin049.png\" alt=\"https://i.imgur.com/rJin049.png\">\nNow <strong>that's a design</strong>. I cannot applaud the ManyPixels team enough and I could not recommend them enough. My confidence in launching <a href=\"https://harvy.app/\">Harvy</a> has definitely improved and I am excited about what the future holds. <a href=\"https://harvy.app/\">Check out the whole homepage</a> and you can see all that they did to help me out - all under 2 weeks (including logo, illustrations, and homepage redesign). <a href=\"https://manypixels.co/referral/m0hfdkk\">ManyPixels even does a referral program</a> (not the original intent of this article) that can get you <a href=\"https://manypixels.co/referral/m0hfdkk\">20% off your subscription</a>. <strong>Design is important</strong>. <strong>Design should be a priority</strong>. </p>\n<p>Don't be like me and think you can \"fake it till you make it\" when it comes to design. Use a landing page builder, use ManyPixels, use 99Designs, use something! (Unless you are a designer, then you already have the skills!)If you want to see all the original designs compared to now, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kevinguebert\">send me a message</a> and I can share them with you. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately I can't put the two side by side here. I'll tell you this though, it's a big change.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://harvy.app/\">Be sure to visit Harvy &#x26; let me know if you have any feedback on this new design!</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Don't think design is a priority?
