While sharing his story with the company he sold, he provides bite-size pieces of advice for running a company. These pieces including having to fire people, hiring people, dealing with investors, dealing with IPOs, and a whole range of topics that oftentimes you don't hear about unless you personally talk with a CEO. A key point that I gathered from the book is that CEOs are not born - one does not wake up one day and know how to run a company. If you are starting a business, you will not do everything perfectly and things will go wrong. How you take the lessons learned and deal with those failures is what will define you as a CEO. You have to face the fire and move forward - no cower back in fear. Thd decision making and problems a CEO face are unique compared to any other job in the world - so if you are interested in becoming one, get ready to work hard.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Running a Company is Hard","date":"June 29, 2018","path":"/2018/06/29/running-a-company-is-hard","tags":["The Hard Thing About Hard Things","Startups","Books"],"excerpt":"Ben Horowitz's *The Hard Thing About Hard Things* is a masterful telling of his struggles and lessons learned while starting a company.
