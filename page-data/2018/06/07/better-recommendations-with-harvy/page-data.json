This latest release does just that!</p>\n<p>The user flow now requires one more steps for users to input before picking a playlist. In the future, I would like to have quicker \"one-click premade\" lists or playlists based on previous listening patterns. But a user inputs songs or artists that they are \"feeling\" for their activity. For example, last night I went for a quick 30 minute run. I knew I needed something more pump-up, EDM-like, so my inputted songs were \"Waiting for Love\" and \"Levels\", both by Avicii. From there, a playlist was crafted based off of those two songs to get similar types of music. A small downside of the current implementation is that the outputted playlist (for some reason), doesn't contain the inputted songs. This will need to be remedied soon. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/kevinguebert\">Let me know if you have any problems or feedback</a>, anything is appreciated!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://harvy.app\">Meet Harvy</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"../../../static/content/images/2018/06/qWNkuATJ3K.gif\" alt=\"Example of User Flow\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Better Recommendations with Harvy","date":"June 07, 2018","path":"/2018/06/07/better-recommendations-with-harvy","tags":["Technology","Startups","Ideas","Coding","Harvy Dev"],"excerpt":"Last night, with some iced coffe in hand, I was able to deploy the latest update to [Harvy](www.harvy.app).
