In the new book on my reading list, <em>The Obstacle is the Way</em> by Ryan Holiday (see <em>The Ego is the Enemy</em>), the opening chapter starts with this idea. Our perception of a situation is what determines the severity of it. If we can turn an obstacle into a <em>learning experience</em> then it isn't an obstacle any longer.</p>\n<p>Ryan outlines 8 steps for how to use our perception the correct way when facing obstacles:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Be objective - don't let feelings or emotions crowd your thoughts and judgments</li>\n<li>Control emotions &#x26; keep an even keel - similar to above, emotions can't rule your perception</li>\n<li>Choose to see the good in the situation - this is a hard one as it may be tough to see the good in all situations</li>\n<li>Steady our nerves - hold fast and stay strong, don't get scared</li>\n<li>Ignore what disturbs or limits others - cryptocurrency crashing? Markets failing? Ignore what scares others</li>\n<li>Place things in perspective - will that small thing today matter tomorrow?</li>\n<li>Focus on what can be controlled - at the end of the day, we can only really change what we can control</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>Post inspired from: <strong>The Obstacle is the Way</strong> by Ryan Holiday.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Steps for Changing our Perception","date":"February 19, 2018","path":"/2018/02/18/steps-for-changing-our-perception","tags":["Books","Personal Growth","Stoicism","The Obstacle is the Way"],"excerpt":"> 'Nothing *makes* us feel this way, we *choose* to give in to such feelings'\nHow many of our obstacles, our problems, and our challenges today are based solely on our *perception*?
