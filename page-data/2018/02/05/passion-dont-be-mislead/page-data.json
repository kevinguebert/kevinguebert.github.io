I read these same books and look at these same Instagram posts - follow your passions and everything will work out. Ryan Holiday in <em>Ego is the Enemy</em> counters those sayings by saying \"don't be passionate\". \"Passion typically masks weakness.\" After pondering on it for a day, I think I've slowly come to agree with him. In moments where I've been passionate about a new idea or a new project, there is weakness in that moment. Why? Well because it is a <em>new</em> project. What happened to my other ones? Well I am masking the fact that I did not complete them, that I lost my passion for them, and, to echo Jocko Willink, I was not disciplined to follow through. Passion is masking my weakness. Holiday actually uses a book I am a fan of to outline this exact scenario - <em>Into the Wild.**Into the Wild</em> follows the story of a man who follows his passion into the wilderness where he eventually passes away because his passion hid misunderstanding and lack of preparation.</p>\n<p>So what does Ryan Holiday offer as a solution? <strong>Purpose and Realism.</strong> Purpose is \"passion with boundaries\" while Realism is \"detachment and perspective\". Passion is <strong>about</strong> while Purpose is <strong>to and for</strong>. Purpose is pursing something outside of yourself, something greater. Realism helps us ask the questions of where to start and what to do.</p>\n<p>Next time you find yourself passionate about an idea then, reframe it - what is the true purpose of it? Being passionate about an idea is easy, but the follow through is hard if there is not a purpose attached to it. \"Make it about what you feel you <strong>must</strong> do and say, not what you <strong>care</strong> about and wish for.\"</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Passion, Don't Be Mislead","date":"February 06, 2018","path":"/2018/02/05/passion-dont-be-mislead","tags":["Books","Personal Growth","Stoicism"],"excerpt":"In this day in age, it's all about passion."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
