Sitting down and saying \"I'm going to be a professional athlete\" is <strong>not enough.</strong> Thinking and accepting this idea that you may have is not enough to get you to that level. You <strong>must work.</strong></p>\n<p>Along the way though, our ego is going to get in the way. Our ego wants our ideas, wants us to aspire to something, it wants that attention and glory of saying you are going to do something (echoing a previous post, The Dope Addiction). But in saying something, we are not progressing - there is no work being done.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"When you are not practicing, someone out there is, and when you meet him, he will win\"</p>\n<p>Bill Bradley</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Practice. Work. Improve. Every time you sit down to work on that side project, to study, to prepare for an exam, to do your homework, remind yourself that the work you are doing is an investment in yourself. Do the work.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Post inspired from: <strong>Ego is the Enemy</strong> by Ryan Holiday.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Fac, si facis","date":"February 06, 2018","path":"/2018/02/05/fac-si-facis","tags":["Books","Personal Growth","Stoicism","Ego is the Enemy"],"excerpt":"What is the difference between working for a company and owning a company with employees?
