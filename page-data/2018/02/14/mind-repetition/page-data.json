Rinse. Repeat.</em> When working on personal-growth, getting better, and working towards out goals, repetition is key. It takes discipline and doing that task every day to form it into a habit which while hopefully lead to success. Sir John Hargrave proposes 3 different ways that can help \"remind your mind\" with these goals.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\"Repetition Reminders\": These are reminders that you will see often - think of a sticky note on the fridge before you open it, sharpie quotes on your mirror, phone backgrounds, daily reminders for the same task. Something where every time you see it, you are reminded of your goal.</li>\n<li>\"Repetition Trackers\": At the start of the New Year, I printed out 3 calendars and put them on my wall. Every day if I complete the task on that calendar, I mark an X on it. This is a form of using Jerry Seinfeld's \"Don't Break the Chain\" methodology. I want to see what the longest chain of crossing off days I can create.</li>\n<li>\"Talking to Yourself\": This methodology is using positive reinforcement while you may be doing seemingly mundane tasks to retrain your brain. While your commuting or exercising, talk to yourself that you are going to succeed. Think about doing a fitness activity - you may think you can't get that last rep or hit that pace, but talking to your self, \"I can do this\" can help train the mind to push you farther.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>Post inspired from: <strong>Mind Hacking</strong> by Sir John Hargrave.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Mind Repetition","date":"February 15, 2018","path":"/2018/02/14/mind-repetition","tags":["Books","Personal Growth"],"excerpt":"*Lather.
