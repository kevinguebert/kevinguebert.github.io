Only self-absorbed assholes think they are too good for whatever their current station requires.\" (94)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What a powerful quote. Our lives are filled with ups and downs, successes and failures. In every moment though, it all matters. Ever moment is \"a chance to do and be our best.\" It is our <em>job</em> to do and be our best. Ryan Holiday outlines what our response should be to our job:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hard work</li>\n<li>Honest</li>\n<li>Helping others as best we can</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What's the point of it though? That's a question with a simple answer: to do your job. That's all there is to it. Doing your job also helps you out in more ways than just productivity. Have you ever done lack-luster work and then looked back onto it with a sense of guilt? Or the thought that \"I could have done better\"? If you do your best in every situation, you can then \"be proud of our choices and confident they're the right ones\" (95). If we do our best, put in our best effort, and do the job, then there's nothing more we could have done. There is no after-thought or guilt that follows us around - we did our best and are confident it was the right decision.</p>\n<p>Each small thing you do is part of the larger goal. Don't forget that goal, but also remember the small moments as those are what help you reach your goal.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Post inspired from: <strong>The Obstacle is the Way</strong> by Ryan Holiday.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Do.
