The list is split up into two segments, or mood scales. One scale measures a person’s positive emotion and the other scale measures the negative. Each segment has ten terms, which can be rated on a scale of 1 to 5 to indicate the extent to which the respondent agrees that this applies to him. The PANAS Scale was developed in 1988 by three American psychologists: David Watson, Lee Anna Clark and Auke Tellegen</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the Maker-in-Chief is none other than <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kevinguebert?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@kevinguebert</a>, who created Emoodji, a personal mood tracker complete with randomized GIFs, automated reminders, and mobile-friendly buttons.
